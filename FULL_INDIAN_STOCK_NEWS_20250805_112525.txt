NSCN-IM chief Q Tuccu rejects unity with NNPGs, says they surrendered Naga identity under Indian Constitution|etimes.in Dzukou Valley, Nagaland (File) Guwahati: The Chairman, National Socialist Council of Nagalim (IM) Q. Tuccu said that for the NSCN to work with NNPGs is a dangerous proposition as NNPGs propagate Naga political solution under the Constitution of India. The Union government signed the vital Framework Agreement with the NSCN-IM, in 2015 and also signed the Agreed Position with the Working Committee of Naga National Political Groups in 2017. NNPG, a Conglomerate of several groups and NSCN-IM has not been on the same page on political solutions for several decades old Naga political problems. Speaking to commemorate 10 Anniversary of Framework agreement, Tuccu said, Nagas are at crossroads, how to bring out working system between the NSCN and WCNNPGs to find common ground for Naga political solution. For the NSCN to work with NNPGs is a dangerous proposition. Because NNPGs propagate Naga political solution under the Constitution of India. Moreover, they are not the master of their own. Government of India agency hold the rein. For NSCN, as the torchbearer of Naga political movement will never take the risk by working with the very groups who have compromised the historical and political identity of the Nagas by failing to defend the sanctity of the uniqueness of the Naga history and political situation while talking with the government of India. This is something weird for those who professed to be working for the political identity of the Nagas.NSCN cannot imagine working with such groups who have no respect for the rights of the Naga nation.Their integrity is no longer compatible with political interests and security of the Nagas. More than anything else, NNPGs was created by the government of India to counterweight the bona fide leadership of NSCN for Naga political solution and signed the copycat of Framework Agreement under the deceitful name Agreed Position. Live Events He added that Nagas are therefore, at crossroads between words and deeds. It is unimaginable for NSCN to share platform with the groups with contrasting stand on Naga political solution. The treacherous politics of NNPGs is no longer hidden from others. Thus, Framework Agreement and Agreed Position are poles apart and we see no meeting point whatsoever. Nagas are also at crossroads between the choice of listening to the call of India to settle for Naga political solution under the banner of the Constitution of India and voice of historical conscience, the call of God given history with our own constitution and flag with divine connection that identify the Nagas as a nation. However, Nagas shall be found wanting if we fail to defend the God given national identity as testified before the world with the signing of the Framework Agreement. Centre and NSCN-IM are holding peace parleys. There is a stalemate between the government of India and NSCN-IM over the contentious issue of separate flag and constitution. NSCN-IM has been demanding a separate flag and Constitution which the government of India had rejected. (You can now

US tariff worries weigh on rupee; RBI rate decision in focus|IANS The Indian rupee is expected to remain weak due to concerns over U.S. tariffs and the upcoming RBI policy decision. The rupee is likely to stay under pressure this week as concerns over steep U.S. tariffs on Indian exports linger, while the Reserve Bank of India s upcoming policy decision also looms large over the currency and government bonds. The rupee closed at 87.54 against the U.S. dollar on Friday, down 1.2 for the week, pressured by persistent foreign portfolio outflows and a 25 levy on Indian exports. While the local unit is hovering near its weakest level since February, fresh tariff announcements on dozens of U.S. trading partners also pushed other Asian currencies to multi-month lows. The dollar index, meanwhile, posted its best weekly gain since 2022 as expectations of a U.S. rate cut in September faded. The odds of a reduction in September rose to 80 after data released on Friday showed that the U.S. economy added fewer jobs than expected, while the unemployment rate rose to 4.2. Live Events Meanwhile, the maturity of a 5 billion dollar-rupee buysell swap conducted by the RBI earlier this year will be in focus on Monday. It would be prudent to break the swap into delivery and rollover. The rupee has probably seen its worst for this quarter and some support will bring it to a desirable level, while not disturbing liquidity, said Alok Singh, group head of treasury at CSB Bank. Traders expect the rupee to trade between 87.00 and 87.80 this week and reckon that the central bank may continue to intervene to limit excessive volatility. Meanwhile, Indias 10-year benchmark 6.33 2035 bond yield, settled at 6.3680 last week, up 2 basis points (bps). Traders anticipate the yield will remain in the 6.33-6.38 band till the RBIs policy decision on Wednesday. The range could be tested on either side, depending on policymakers decision and guidance. Although some market participants expect a rate cut, a majority of economists polled by Reuters believe RBI will hold rates steady this time. While it is a close call, our bias remains for a 25 bps rate cut at the August meeting, Citi said. A drop in Indias retail inflation to a more-than-six-year low in June, coupled with expectations that it may slip to a record low in July, have heightened hopes of a rate cut. However, RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra last month said that the bar for further easing is now higher than it would have been if the stance was still accommodative. The central bank slashed rates by a steeper-than-expected 50 bps in June and shifted its policy stance to neutral from accommodative. As the RBI awaits the impact of the large easing it has already done, we believe it will stay put on repo rate changes on 6 August, HSBC said in a note.

Oil slips as OPEC+ proceeds with September output hike|ANI Oil prices declined following OPECs decision to increase production by 547,000 barrels per day in September, fueled by concerns about a slowing U.S. economy. Oil prices extended declines on Monday after OPEC agreed to another large production hike in September, with concerns about a slowing economy in the U.S., the worlds biggest oil user, adding to the pressure. Brent crude futures fell 40 cents, or 0.57, to 69.27 a barrel by 0115 GMT while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude was at 66.96 a barrel, down 37 cents, or 0.55, after both contracts closed about 2 a barrel lower on Friday. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies, known as OPEC, agreed on Sunday to raise oil production by 547,000 barrels per day for September, the latest in a series of accelerated output hikes to regain market share, citing a healthy economy and low stockpiles as reasons behind its decision. The move, in line with market expectations, marks a full and early reversal of OPECs largest tranche of output cuts, plus a separate increase in output for the United Arab Emirates, amounting to about 2.5 million bpd, or about 2.4 of world demand. Analysts at Goldman Sachs expect that the actual increase in supply from the eight OPEC countries that have raised output since March will be 1.7 million bpd, or about 23 of what has been announced, because other members of the group have cut output after previously overproducing. Live Events While OPEC policy remains flexible and the geopolitical outlook uncertain, we assume that OPEC keeps required production unchanged after September, they said in a note, adding that solid growth in non-OPEC output would likely leave little room for extra OPEC barrels. RBC Capital Markets analyst Helima Croft said: The bet that the market could absorb the additional barrels seems to have paid off for the holders of spare capacity this summer, with prices not that far off from pre-tariff Liberation Day levels. Still, investors remain wary of further U.S. sanctions on Iran and Russia that could disrupt supplies. U.S. President Trump has threatened to impose 100 secondary tariffs on Russian crude buyers as he seeks to pressure Russia into halting its war in Ukraine. At least two vessels loaded with Russian oil bound for refiners in India have diverted to other destinations following new U.S. sanctions, trade sources said on Friday, and LSEG trade flows showed. However, two Indian government sources told Reuters on Saturday the country will keep purchasing oil from Russia despite Trumps threats. Concerns about U.S. tariffs impacting global economic growth and fuel consumption are also hanging over the market, especially after U.S. economic data on jobs growth on Friday was below expectations. U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said on Sunday that the tariffs imposed last week on scores of countries are likely to stay in place rather than be cut as part of continuing negotiations.

Semiconductor mission pushes India from being aspirant to becoming global powerhouse|ANI Representational image India is undergoing a transformative journey in the semiconductor space, rapidly building an ecosystem that promises to position the country as a major hub in the global chip manufacturing and design value chain. What makes a phone smart? A computer processes millions of commands in a fraction of a second. A TV brings out the reality as it is happening right now. A satellite collects data and sends signals across the world. It all comes down to that tiny thing called a semiconductor chip, which one can hold between ones fingers. With the global chip market expected to surpass USD 1 trillion by 2030, India is not only aiming to reduce its dependence on imports but also to emerge as a trusted partner in the diversified global supply chain, PIB shared as part of its backgrounder series. At the heart of this transformation is the India Semiconductor Mission (ISM), launched in December 2021 with an outlay of Rs 76,000 crore. The mission is aimed at fostering chip manufacturing, packaging, testing, and design capabilities. It also promotes collaboration between academia and industry to boost RD and develop a highly skilled talent pool. Live Events As per industry estimates, Indias chip market stood at approximately USD 38 billion in 2023 and is projected to grow to USD 100-110 billion by 2030. This growth is underpinned by a strategic policy push from the government, which includes several fiscal incentive schemes. Under the Semiconductor Fabs Scheme, companies receive up to 50 per cent financial support for setting up semiconductor fabrication plants. Similar schemes support display manufacturing, packaging units (ATMPOSAT), and design startups through the Design Linked Incentive (DLI) scheme. By far, six major semiconductor projects have been approved. These include multi-billion-dollar investments from Tata Group, Micron Technology, CG Power, Kaynes Semicon, and an HCL-Foxconn joint venture. Together, these units will collectively produce millions of chips and wafers per month, fulfilling both growing domestic and global demand. Indias design ecosystem is also seeing rapid growth. The recent inauguration of 3-nanometer chip design centres in Noida and Bengaluru marked a breakthrough in high-end chip innovation. To encourage this trend, the DLI scheme has supported as many as 22 startups with Rs 234 crore in funding. These companies are designing chips for critical applications such as CCTV surveillance, mobile networks, smart devices, and automotive systems. Skill development is another key priority under the semiconductor mission. Over 85,000 engineers are being trained in advanced semiconductor and electronics manufacturing, with over 44,000 already certified under the SMART Lab initiative at NIELIT Calicut. Partnerships with global institutions like Purdue University and industry leaders like IBM and Lam Research aim to align Indian talent with international standards. Indias growing ambition in semiconductors is showcased annually at the SEMICON India summit, the flagship event hosted in partnership with SEMI (Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International). The 2025 edition, set to take place at New Delhis Yashobhoomi during September 2-4, will see over 300 exhibitors from 18 countries, including pavilions from Japan, South Korea, Singapore, and Malaysia. With country roundtables, design startup showcases, and skilling forums, the event will highlight Indias commitment to collaboration and innovation across the semiconductor value chain. The geopolitical shocks of the COVID-19 pandemic and the Ukraine conflict exposed vulnerabilities in the global semiconductor supply chain, dominated by a few nations like Taiwan, South Korea, China, and the United States. Indias push for local manufacturing and design is both a strategic and economic response to reduce reliance on such concentrated geographies. With abundant raw materials, a thriving MSME sector for component manufacturing, and a large base of engineers skilled in AI, IoT, and cloud computing, India is uniquely placed to contribute to the entire semiconductor lifecycle. As approved facilities begin operations and new projects take shape, the country is positioning itself as a trusted hub for semiconductor manufacturing, strengthening its digital economy, national security, and technological self-reliance. From dependence to dominance, the chip revolution is real and its happening right here, right now in Bharat, the PIB essay concluded. (You can now
Goldman keeps Brent oil forecast, but flags downside risks to demand|Goldman keeps Brent oil forecast, but flags downside risks to demand Reuters Mon, Aug 4, 2025, 9:56 AM 2 min read In This Article: CLF -0.36 (Reuters) -Goldman Sachs on Sunday reiterated its oil price forecast with Brent averaging 64 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2025 and 56 in 2026, but expects an increasing range of risks to its baseline estimates from recent developments. Increasing pressure on Russia and Iran sanctioned oil supply poses an upside risk to our price forecast, especially given the faster-than-expected normalization in spare capacity, the investment bank said in an August 3 note. However, Goldman flagged a downside risk to its 800,000 barrels per day average annual demand growth forecast in 2025-2026 due to the increase in U.S. tariff rates, threats of additional secondary tariffs and weak U.S. economic activity data. The weaker data suggests that the U.S. economy is now growing at a below-potential pace, which the banks economists feel has increased the chance of a recession in the next 12 months, the note said. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies such as Russia, known as OPEC, agreed on Sunday to raise oil production by 547,000 barrels per day for September, the latest in a series of accelerated output hikes to regain market share. While OPEC policy remains flexible, we assume OPEC will keep its production quota unchanged after September as we expect the pace of builds in OECD commercial stocks to accelerate and seasonal demand tailwinds to fade away, Goldman said. Brent crude futures were trading at 69.27 a barrel at 0115 GMT while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude was at 66.96 a barrel. OR We continue to see limited risk of large disruptions in Russia supply given the large volumes of Russian imports, the possibility for deepening price discounts to maintain demand, and continuing reported eagerness of the key buyers - China and India, analysts at Goldman Sachs said. Indian state refiners have stopped buying Russian oil in the past week as discounts narrowed this month and U.S. President Donald Trump warned countries not to purchase oil from Moscow, industry sources said.

Unilever India’s new CEO Priya Nair has to invigorate a sluggish consumer giant|Agencies Unilever Indias new CEO Priya Nair Hindustan Unilever Ltd.s new Chief Executive Officer Priya Nair is inheriting Indias largest consumer goods maker that has seen stuttering growth in the last few years. While the Indian unit of Unilever Plc posted a forecast-beating quarterly profit last week, Nair, who took over the CEO role on Aug. 1, has her task cut out in sustaining this momentum. The companys stock has inched up about 4 in the last three years while the benchmark NSE Nifty 50 index surged almost 42. Its volume growth has been sluggish. Sales expansion has been a fraction of the 2022 levels while disruptor local brands are eating into its market share across product categories. Often seen as the bellwether of the consumer sentiment in the worlds most-populous nation, Hindustan Unilever, or HUL, also was dragged down by a consumption slowdown in India over the past year. So strong was investor disappointment that the sudden announcement about Rohit Jawa stepping down as the CEO half-way through his term to make way for Nair stoked a stock rally on July 11. Live Events The first woman CEO for HUL was earlier serving as the president for the beauty unit and the Global Chief Marketing Officer at the London-based parent. Nair has led the Indian units home care, beauty and wellbeing businesses in the past. Nuvama Wealth Management called Nair a more aggressive leader in a note soon after her appointment was announced. Nairs focus remains on delivering volume-led competitive growth that is profitable and sustainable, a representative for Unilevers India unit said in an email. The company will share more details at an appropriate time. Not Kept Pace Hindustan Unilever has had a problem for multiple years, said Arvind Singhal, founder at retail consultancy Technopak Advisors. India has been changing rapidly and they havent been able to keep pace with Indias changes. The seller of Bru coffee and Dove soaps was battling a consumer demand slowdown in the past few quarters as picky city buyers chose to spend less or switched to artisanal products. Hindustan Unilever gets about two-thirds of its sales from urban India, while rural areas contribute the rest. The firm will have to have a fresh distribution strategy and rejig margin structure, Singhal said. It will also need to develop new products, and figure out the categories which can be rebuilt, he said. Sales growth in the recent past has been tepid too, dragged down by global price volatility in raw materials like palm oil and coffee, though the June quarter saw the return of revenue expansion. Nair will also be in the global spotlight. Unilevers new CEO Fernando Fernandez told analysts last week after its quarterly earnings that it would be investing a disproportionate amount in the US and India, adding that momentum is building in India. India is Unilevers second-largest market by revenue after the US and the largest by volume. Fernandez praised Nairs deep understanding of our home and personal care business in India that she successfully ran for many years. She also has the international markets knowledge to keep the companys portfolio in turn with consumer needs, he said. HULs beauty and personal care segments they contribute over a third of HULs sales have been hit by rising competition from local startups like Honasa Consumer Ltd., with its Mamaearth brand, and global rivals like LOreal SA pushing hard into India. Jawa, Nairs predecessor, tried to double down on premiumization through the firms ASPIRE strategy by upgrading its legacy brands, adding new brands and spending on digital push. In January, HUL acquired skincare upstart Minimalist for 26.7 billion rupees (305 million), in one of the biggest local deals for a cosmetics startup. Ratings Upgrade At least three brokerages including Goldman Sachs upgraded their ratings outlook on HUL on Friday and at least 17 analysts, including Jefferies and Citi, raised their price target for the stock, signaling that Nair has the wind at her back. We look forward to an update on the strategy as the new CEO takes over, Jefferies analysts including Vivek Maheshwari wrote in a note Friday. (You can now

Dont blindly trust any brand, company to last forever, track new flows to better investing, advises this MF house CEO|Synopsis Capitalmind Mutual Fund, the newest entrant in the Rs.75 tn Indian MF industry, relies on quant-based, data-driven strategies over subjective calls. Momentum is a key pillar, but the approach remains flexible. Deepak Shenoy, CEO, Capitalmind MF, tells ET Wealth what investors can expect from the fund house and its latest flexi-cap fund offering. ET Bureau As per Shenoy, investors must think about how they are going to spend their money in the long term, and not just fixate on how to build wealth for themselves. After eight years running a Portfolio Management Service (PMS), what convinced you to enter the mutual fund space? There is growing recognition that people need professional asset managers, but many may not have the Rs.50 lakh typically required to access a PMS or an Alternative Investment Fund (AIF). Mutual funds offer easier access to asset classes such as equity, debt, gold, and international stocks. In some way, almost all our investors, even in the PMS space, would have a mutual fund portfolio as well, because itâs not easy to use a PMS to access debt markets or overseas markets. We realised we were not able to serve the complete needs of investors, even HNIs. We want to serve customers in a more holistic way. Income Tax Guide Income Tax Slabs FY 2025-26 Income Tax Calculator 2025 New Income Tax Bill 2025 HNIs and retail investors are similar in the sense that they need diversification, or access to different asset classes. Taxes are more efficient in a mutual fund. Multiple asset classes have now become equal to an extent. Insurance, for instance, enjoyed a huge tax advantage earlier versus mutual funds. That has more or less evened out. Tax exemption on Employeesâ Provident Fund (EPF) contributions has also been capped to a certain extent, leading to greater parity among different asset classes. People are better off investing through mutual funds than investing on their own. You pay capital gains tax and dividend tax if you invest on your own or through a PMS or AIF. Mutual funds give you a taxation-efficient approach. Further, in PMS, your ability to get everybody aligned to the same portfolio is very complicated. Some people may enter early, some late; some stocks may have run up by that time. So you have to buy smaller positions in some stocks and larger positions in others. Sometimes you do not want to buy any more of some stock, but you do not want to sell it. So some investors own a stock, but others donât. This is the complexity in PMS, because we are managing individual accounts. In a pooled vehicle like a mutual fund, everybody gets access to the same set of stocks, whether they have five units or 5,000. So that way, it is easier. Plus, you get access to large stocks or large portfolios. Overall, the mutual fund is a more attractive pooled vehicle. You are known as a data-driven asset manager. Is that how you will differentiate yourself in the MF arena? Quant-based investing is our forte. Thatâs what we excel in and are most comfortable with. Thatâs why our first NFO, Capitalmind Flexicap, is oriented towards people looking at a more quantitative approach. While we may have analyst coverage of 30 to 60 companies, our primary reason to buy these stocks will be quant-based. That is how we differentiate ourselves, but it does not mean that this is the only way. There are lots of ways to make money in the markets. Some of them require value and subjective analysis, which other mutual funds are doing quite well. Since our approach is quant-led, we have less focus on subjectively driven value or growth potential, because our ability to choose a stock is very strongly dependent on what shows up in the numbersâ whether we use prices, profitability or growth, those numbers need to show up in the data. For instance, we may not buy a stock when it is a turnaround story. We may buy if the turnaround reflects in the data. Thatâs the kind of fund house we are. Youâve been running a successful momentum strategy. Will that define your mutual fund investing style? Yes, what we have figured out is that momentum is one of the strongest factors in the investment zone. Having said that, it does not work in two types of marketsâ when there is no trend and when there is a strong downtrend. We have other ways to figure out the markets in such situations. So in the no-trend phase, we could move to different factors. We may buy into stocks of another factor itself. If the market has a downtrend, then our process will take us into hedging territory. We will still be 65 equity, but we will have hedges to our positions so that we are less exposed to the market and earning yield at that time, because we want to ride out the downtrend and then buy into stocks later. How has your investing experience shaped your thought process? How have you refined your framework? A lot of times while we talk about things like back-testing, quantitative analysis and all that, the biggest thing weâve learned is that you canât always trust the data. 90 of our job is cleaning the data. If you give an experienced woodcutter an axe, heâll spend half an hour sharpening the axe and only 10-15 minutes cutting. Similarly, stock selection forms only 10-15 of our overall time exposure. More time is spent refining the model, working through various scenarios, which weâve learned in real life. One of our beliefs is that price sentiment is a very important driver of returns; sometimes even more important than earnings growth itself. We gauge perception using prices, market information that allows us to get confidence about a stock. Second, we donât try to predict, we respond. It is easier to do that. So when you have surprises, you donât have to worry that you are wrong in your prediction and then make a change. You donât have to predict at all. At some point, if things change, you change. We donât have any problem churning stocks. One thing Iâve realised is that the best companies can falter. You canât trust that a brand or a company will last forever. So if a company is great today, things may change. You must track news flow carefully and gauge promoter hunger. Promoters who are hungry will typically drive their companies faster up the curve. But some of them may actually have corporate governance issues. So you have to be very careful of corporate governance as a concept. We have included this in some of the discretionary elements in our flexi-cap fund. Recent years have seen a lot of chatter around underperformance in active funds. What are your thoughts? We have observed that active tends to beat passive. Also, passive itself underperforms the index by a considerable degree. If you compare the corresponding active funds to the best of the passive funds, you find that the outperformance ratios of active funds becomes even higher. Often itâs just 30-40 basis points that makes the active fund outperform the passive fund, but underperform the index. Passive can only execute according to the index, whereas the fund manager has many levers. I can use derivatives to get into or out of a stock as an active fund manager. Passive fund is also not allowed to migrate away from the index, even if the companies underlying it are bad or have shown bad corporate governance. There is no choice in that matter. We can actively change those positions if bad things happen. Lastly, our fee structures are very low. Direct funds are charging between 0.5-1.1. So active management is here to stay. I think there is a lot of outperformance potential in active. Your first offering, a flexi-cap fund, comes into a space currently filled with look-alike offerings running a distinct large-cap bias. How will you position it? Our approach is quantitative in nature, which is a little oddity among flexi-cap funds, because they tend to be more discretion-led than quantitative. Also, we recognise that the flexi-cap strategy actually allows for flexibility, which means it allows us to change our mind, our strategy. It allows international diversification also. The flexi-cap mandate has the most potential to diversify. Thatâs why I feel it is useful for us. The other part of the equation is using technology and execution excellence, whether it is building better execution frameworks for stocks, that means we can get them at a lower price than otherwise, or by simply using the positional attributes better. So we will hedge in downtrending markets, we may write covered calls in up-trending markets, etc. We may be able to exploit a different factor over a period of time. Will you prefer operating within niche categories or have a wider bouquet of offerings? We may not offer a lot of funds, but we do want to cover the bigger categories within equity, debt and hybrid. We may not have all of large-cap, mid-cap, solution-oriented, value, momentum, and others. But we will have a few more in the equity categories. If RBI opens the limits, we may look at international stocks, both within existing funds, and for a new category of funds. We will have a few offerings in the debt and hybrid categories as well. How are you reading the current market scenario? From a long-term perspective, India has a great story, whether it is infrastructure, new inventions, manufacturing or domestic consumption. This is the point at which we start moving away from the essentials, which is food, shelter, clothing, into discretionary items like travel, tourism, hospitality, and so on. So this is a time when the push is likely to happen. More people are also keen on spending and enjoying themselves. That is a concept we have called âwin-at-lifeâ, which suggests that you should not worry about your long-term investments if they are in the right place. Beyond what you are saving for your goals, you should be able to spend. And that spending is what will make you happy. Investors must also think about how they are going to spend their money in the long term, and not just fixate on how to build wealth for themselves. What themes and sectors are you favouring? Since the flexi-cap strategy is quantitative, it figures out what to buyâwhether it is momentum, value or any other. By and large, we find that all the sectors that are India-facing are poised for long term growth. They are likely to come into all momentum portfolios. In PMS, we used to see companies come into the momentum portfolio first, and then the favourable news flows would come through. Many of these sectors like defence and manufacturing continue to be favourable but we will buy those only if our algorithm suggests so. RAPID FIRE Q.

To secure US trade deal, key Indian ministries told to list what they can bring to talks table|FOLLOWING US President Donald Trumps tariff sledgehammer, the Indian government has kicked off an exercise to thrash out concessions across sectors that can be offered in the tariff negotiations later this month. Key economic ministries have been asked to see what they can still afford to offer to sweeten New Delhis deal when the US team is here on August 25. To reach an agreement, the Trump administration has been demanding much more than what the government has offered in its market access commitments, including lowering of tariffs across the board and removal of non-tariff trade barriers. As policymakers grapple with Trumps announcement of a 25 per cent tariff on goods from August 7, alongside an additional but unspecified penalty for its defence and energy imports from Russia, economic ministries have started sending in sectoral tariff concessions in their jurisdictions. There are indications oil refiners have started reducing Russian oil purchases. Some of these concessions, if calibrated well, could ensure an opening up of the domestic economy, sources aware of discussions at the highest levels told The Indian Express. In fact, it was an external crisis that had forced the reforms of 1991. Most importantly, the sources said, an unnecessary show of bravado in countering some of Trumps assertions, however ridiculous they may be, should be avoided. India was one of the first countries the Trump administration had expected to sign a deal with, but slow progress has been a source of frustration for Washington DC. Like countries around the world scrambling to deal with Trumps tariff threats, India had largely adopted a principled, but non-confrontational, stance in an attempt to balance selective concessions with caution to safeguard its economic growth, and circumvent a backlash from domestic producers. Sources closely tracking the US talks with others said a majority of the countries that rushed to sign deals with the worlds biggest economy ended up with lopsided agreements that effectively extracted more than what it gave. This includes the UK and Australia that have a trade deficit with the US. On talks with New Delhi, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC Thursday: Well, I dont know whats going to happen; it will be up to India. India came to the table early. They have been slow-rolling things, so I think that the President, the whole trade team is frustrated with them. And also, India has been a large buyer of sanctioned Russian oil, that they then resell as refined products. So, they have not been a great global actor. The assumption in New Delhi has always been that Washington DC will maintain a differential of 10-20 per cent in tariffs between China and India; and that the Americans would be cognizant of Indias traditional redlines that have endured for decades, including concerns over GM food crops and the need to safeguard the interest of the vast subsistence-level manufacturing base that has an oversized contribution to labour-intensive exports. The government is also keen to stay away from offering duty concessions on imports of agri items such as soybean, corn and dairy, in the interim deal. While the government has offered to cut tariffs on 55 per cent of US imports, this could be pushed up in the upcoming talks, given that in FTAs with Japan, Korea, and ASEAN, over 80 per cent of tariff lines were down to zero. Sources said the outer limit for a deal with the US, currently pegged at around October, could be brought forward, if fresh negotiations are positive. What complicates the equation for India is that the Chinese are at an advanced stage of negotiations towards a deal, which could have a favourable tariff rate and potential waivers on secondary tariffs, including possibly the tariff on account of Russian oil imports and the proposed 10 per cent BRICS tariff. China is currently faced with a 30 per cent tariff. From New Delhis perspective, a deal needs to be clinched precisely for ensuring the gap in tariffs between India and China is maintained, even with a limited early-harvest type of deal. There is, however, greater receptiveness now within the policy circles to cut tariffs on some industrial goods, especially intermediate goods where there is the twin problem of high duties and an inverted duty structure (duty being higher on inputs than on final products). Alongside, there is a willingness to grant concessions in sectors such as public procurement and agri provided these are matched by the other side, like in the case of the UK deal. Also, India is willing to import more from the US, especially in three big-ticket sectors defence equipment, fossil fuels and nuclear to manage Trumps constant references to the trade gap, the sources said. Tariff rebalancing, if done right, could potentially offer an impetus to the economy, given that the biggest beneficiaries of tariff protection, especially the non-tariff barriers such as an increasing array of QCOs (quality control orders), are the big players. MSME units have been calling for these QCOs to be removed, especially in areas such as steel and textiles. Since 1991, New Delhi has gradually reduced its average tariff from nearly 79 per cent in 1990 to around 12 per cent in 2013, following which it has gone back up to 16-17 per cent by 2023. Sectors such as agriculture, dairy and automobiles, continue to be protected, even as the Ministry of Commerce and industry maintains that its trade measures are WTO compliant. Unlike its response during Trumps first term, where retaliatory tariffs were imposed, New Delhi has desisted from retaliating and is working on strategic concessions in sectors that the US is keen to target, while adhering to its own broad red lines. This involves areas symbolic of trade openness, including nuclear energy, fossil fuels and defence procurement. Think tanks such as Delhi-based Global Trade Research Initiative have said that by refusing to cross its red lines, particularly on agriculture, India has helped avoid the trap of a one-sided deal. Once the official level discussions wrap up, there is a sense that a final call on the deal could come down to a conversation between the two leaders, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Trump.

The greatest rivalries in sport – India v Pakistan|Indias Arshdeep Singh celebrating the wicket of Pakistan captain Babar Azam during the 2022 ICC Mens T20 World Cup in Australia. Photo Photosport Advertise with NZME. The Alternative Commentary Collectives Agenda podcast is launching four special episodes under the Versus banner in which they examine some of the greatest ever sporting rivalries. This week we travel to the subcontinent to examine the most intense cricket rivalry on the planet. The ACCs series is powered by Bonds Chaffe Off Undies. Week one: Auckland vs Canterbury and the rugby rivalry that defined the 1980s When India meet Pakistan in cricket it is more than a match. It is a happening a happening defined by shared history, by partition, by religion, border disputes, famine, assassination, tragedy, geopolitics, terrorism, nuclear threats and, of course, a fervour for the game of cricket that is unparalleled anywhere else in the world. The Ashes might have more history and a dinky little trophy, but nobody is rioting on the streets of Wagga Wagga or Wiveliscombe when their team loses. Advertise with NZME. Advertise with NZME. The story of cricket between Pakistan and India is the story of these two mighty nations writ large. From hopelessly deadlocked test series, to era-defining World Cup clashes, the rivalry has had it all and sometimes even a bit more. Wrote Peter Oborne in the brilliant Wounded Tiger - A History of Cricket in Pakistan : It was becoming evident that tests between Pakistan and India had developed a unique sensibility. Those who were normal became slightly mad. Those who were already troubled were temporarily blinded with a kind of insanity. One of the curiosities of this rivalry is that it is comparatively new. The Roses Match between Lancashire and Yorkshire was first played in 1855; India and Pakistan did not meet until close to 100 years later. There was a good reason for that: Pakistan did not exist. It is, in fact, the difficult birth of that country that gives the rivalry such piquancy. Advertise with NZME. The history of British Raj modern-day India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Myanmar is long and complicated, but the critical element for this rivalry is that when India gained independence from Great Britain in 1947, Lord Mountbatten, the Queens cousin and last viceroy of India, determined that the formation of a separate Muslim state was the most expedient way to avoid civil war. Known forever as Partition, crude lines were drawn on a map and Pakistan was born creating, in the stroke of a pen, millions upon millions of religious refugees. The violence was extraordinary as many of these refugees attempted to migrate, with at least one million deaths reported. From the chaos emerged two distinct countries (actually, three when you consider that East Pakistan fought for and gained independence in 1971, becoming Bangladesh) sworn enemies who fight over disputed regions and worship different prophets, yet remain so culturally connected. Nowhere is that cultural connection more apparent than in cricket. By at least one account, cricket was first played at Cambay (near Ahmedabad) in 1721. It became a beguiling way for East India Company employees to befriend wary locals. Cricket clubs sprang up in all the major centres. In India it is often said that the two biggest nation-builders were the railways and cricket. Pakistan was admitted to the Imperial Cricket Conference (as the ICC was then known) in 1952 and a tour to India was scheduled for that year. The squad would include four who had previously played for India including captain Abdul Kardar, the Father of Pakistan Cricket. In the fragile post-Partition days, cricket was seen as both a potential peacemaker and a way for each side of the divide to demonstrate their sporting superiority. Pretty soon it became evident that the latter part of that equation was most pressing. That first tour would set the template for much of what was to follow over the next 30 years of intermittent contact. The first two tests were split, with the crowd in Lucknow making it very clear what they thought about the local side losing to the upstarts. India would save face by winning the next test and that would be the last positive result either way in this fixture for 26 years. Yes, you read that right. Both teams became so terrified of losing the rivalry became infamous for petrifyingly dull cricket as Oborne described it. Diplomatic incidents, such as Kardar offending the Indian delegation during the after-match formalities in 1952, were more spicy than any of the on-field action. Between that third test of the inaugural series in India and the second test at Lahore on Indias 1978 tour to Pakistan, they squared off in 13 tests and drew them all. There was a little flurry of results following that, including a 3-0 Pakistan win when India toured for a six-test series in 1982-83, but there followed another dry patch, with just one positive result in the next 17, which also included a cancelled test in 1984 following the assassination of Indian prime minister Indira Gandhi. Advertise with NZME. In December, 2007, Pakistan and India met at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru. India batted first and posted 626 on the shoulders of Sourav Gangulys 239. Pakistan replied with 537, Misbah-ul-Haq starring with an unbeaten 133. The match petered out to an inevitable draw. And that was all she wrote. In November of the following year, 10 members of Lashkar-e-Taiba, a Pakistan-based Islamist militant organisation, carried out 12 shooting and bombing attacks over four days across iconic locations in Mumbai, including the Taj Hotel and Leopold Cafe, killing 166 innocents. In 2009, a bus carrying the Sri Lankan team in Lahore was attacked, with six police and two civilians killed. India has refused to entertain the idea of touring Pakistan since (a stance graphically illustrated during this years ICC Champions Trophy ostensibly hosted by Pakistan, although India played all their games, including the final, in Dubai), and test cricket between the two has ceased. All told, the most heated rivalry in cricket has seen just 59 tests in the 78 years of Pakistans existence. Unless the cricket gods contrive to pit them in a World Test Championship final on neutral soil, it is difficult to imagine a scenario where they play each other again anytime soon in the red-ball format. This was a rivalry that needed limited overs cricket like a fire needs oxygen. It was one-dayers that reignited the rivalry and T20 cricket that reshaped it for the next generations. The modern rivalry can be telescoped into two epic matches. Advertise with NZME. The initial flashpoint was Sharjah, 1986, in the little-remembered, unless youre a Pakistani, Austral-Asia Cup. These types of tournaments in Sharjah would later become a hotbed of match-fixing, but in the early days the Emirate was described by the New Indian Express as crickets El Dorado. Sheikh Abdul Rahman Bukhatir, an Arab schooled in Pakistan, fell in love with the game and saw an opportunity to build events around the Indo-Pak rivalry. In this tournament they met in the final in front of a packed house of mostly expat labourers in the oil industry. India scored 245, considered a big total in those days, with their top three of Kris Srikkanth, Sunil Gavaskar and Dilip Vengsarkar all passing 50. The Pakistan chase faltered badly, and when their talisman Imran Khan was the sixth man out at 209 with the overs fast ticking away, the game was as good as gone. The bloke at the other end, however, had other ideas. Javed Miandad, the moustachioed and self-styled street fighter from Karachi, had an eye for drama. Somehow he conjured up a century and found himself on strike with four needed to win off the final Chetan Sharma delivery. Sharma went for the yorker and instead dealt a knee-high full toss that Miandad put into the stands. Cue, mayhem. When Miandad is asked to recall the match, which is often (it was the subject of a documentary in Pakistan), he makes no attempt to understate his genius. I always prayed that I would do something big. I used to tell myself, even if I die in the field, I dont care. Its like a soldier dying on duty. It is shahadat (martyrdom). That innings was like a gift to me. I didnt play cricket like that, ever. That match, it was like a film. When I dream, it was like a film whose story has been written and now the film is being made This is a gift. To describe it is impossible. This was a gift from God. Pakistan fans during the 2022 ICC Mens T20 World Cup between India and Pakistan. Photo Photosport Pakistanis describe this match as the starting point of their dominance that would end with the World Cup title in 1992, a title that should have ended in the semifinals when New Zealand dominated for all but the final 15 of the 100 overs, when a young Inzamam-ul-Haq combined with that man again, Miandad, to break the hearts of the home team. Advertise with NZME. If Sharjah was important for Pakistan, then another clash between the two reshaped the entire sport. The stage was The Wanderers, Johannesburg, and the occasion was the final of the inaugural World T20 The Match That Changed Cricket Forever. To that point, T20s place in crickets portfolio was unclear. In particular India, who, with a burgeoning, TV-buying middle class were rapidly emerging as the games financial powerhouse, seemed nonplussed by the format. On this day, however, the country was gripped as they successfully defended a middling 157. With six runs needed off four balls and just one wicket left, Pakistans Misbah attempted a scoop, the catch was taken and the touchpaper was lit. Unlike Miandads hyperbole following Sharjah, the impact of this final is impossible to overstate. Within a year, Brendon McCullum was electrifying the Bangalore crowd with 158 not out in the inaugural Indian Premier League match and cricket has never been the same since. It has also changed the dynamics of the rivalry. Indian crickets board of control, the BCCI, has no financial imperative to play Pakistan. It owns the IPL, which in less than 20 years has established itself as one of the worlds richest sports leagues. The ICC, the global games governing body, on the other hand needs the rivalry to help sell the media and sponsorship packages to their showpiece tournaments (about 80 of the ICCs revenue comes from the Indian market), because advertisers love nothing better than the prospect of hundreds of millions of eyeballs fixed on them when these two nations meet. To an extent, the rivalry has been taken outside the continent. The South Asian diaspora fuels it. One report stated there were two million applications for 17,000 available tickets to a World T20 clash between the two teams in Long Island last year. Advertise with NZME. Where once there was a dark side to it, whether it was corruption or outbreaks of violence following defeats, nowadays the scarcity means it is usually a good-natured celebration of the sport. This is of course still a political element that hangs over every exchange between those countries, but if anything cricket has become a way to celebrate their shared culture, rather than an exacerbation of their differences.

Nepal, China steel may face duty evasion probe|Agencies The Directorate of Revenue Intelligence could initiate a probe into steel imports from Nepal and China, a move aimed at protecting the domestic industry from cheap, substandard imports, said people familiar with the development. It comes after Nepal emerged as one of the top three steel exporters to India despite the absence of significant manufacturing facilities, they said. In some instances, a Nepal-based company was exporting steel many times over its nameplate capacity, an official told ET on condition of anonymity. This triggered apprehensions of Chinese steel being routed through Nepal, as alleged by the Indian industry. Nepal has unilateral duty-free access to the Indian market, allowing its exporters to send steel products to India without paying any duty. On the contrary, direct exports from China attract at least 12 safeguard duty. Live Events Nepals share in Indias finished steel imports during the first three months of this financial year averaged 15.93, making the neighbouring country the third largest steel exporter to India during this period. In another instance, Chinas Shangyang Steel wrote to Indias Directorate General of Foreign Trade alleging that other Chinese companies were falsifying documents affirming quality compliance. Shangyang Steel holds a certificate issued by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS). The company alleged that other Chinese companies were misrepresenting the BIS certificate issued to Shangyang Steel and lying while exporting to India, the official said. Last month, the steel ministry issued a clarification saying that not only are finished and semi-finished steel imports required to adhere to quality control orders (QCOs) but also the raw material used as input needs to comply with the quality regime. Officials also found that some Indian importers with a BIS certificate were importing substandard steel products from China or Nepal and doing just cosmetic value addition to them. The QCO norms require importers not only to comply with the coating part for which it has certification, but also to ensure that the base material also sticks to quality norms, the official said. A BIS certificate is enforced through QCO, which the government issues. The order mainly affects the traders who act as middlemen in importing steel without adding any value to the steel. MSMEs (micro, small and medium enterprises) are not affected by this order; it hurts the middle parties, and they are the ones who are creating a furore over this, the official added. (You can now
MPC must ignore Trump’s latest jibe, and stay focused on inflation risks and price stability goals|Synopsis Economists largely agree that Trumps tariff policies will likely cause slower growth and higher inflation. Despite global concerns, Indias MPC has cut rates, believing growth will be impacted without significant inflation. However, rising oil prices and market signals suggest potential inflationary pressures, prompting a possible shift in RBIs stance towards prioritizing price stability. Mythili Bhusnurmath ET Now Consulting Editor Oh, itâs very much undead Nothing is certain except death and taxes, said Benjamin Franklin. In the post-Trump world, one can add a third: slower growth and higher inflation or stagflation, in economists lexicon. And possibly a fourth: Trump-induced turbulence, as evidenced by the latest round of tariff hikes announced last week. In a profession noted for its discontents-If all the economists were laid end to end, theyd never reach a conclusion, said George Bernard Shaw-Trump has achieved the near impossible. Hes ensured almost complete unanimity among economists on the likely outcome of his chop-and-change policy on tariffs : lower growth, higher inflation. What explains economist-dominated MPCs decision to tread a different path and take a decidedly one-sided view of how Trumps tariffs will impact Indias macro economy? Indian exceptionalism? Market capture? The desire of a relatively newly minted MPC (it has yet to complete a year in office in its present avatar) to respond to a nod-and-a-wink from North Block? Core inflation remains subdued, and overall inflation is comfortably below the RBI s 4 target, affording room for the easing cycle to be sustained, says the finance ministry, crossing the unstated Lakshman rekha between the executive and RBI on interest rate policy in its latest monthly report. More importantly, will it continue down that path at its three-day meet, starting tomorrow? Unlike its peers worldwide, MPC seems to believe that growth will be adversely impacted, but not inflation. So, it has cut the policy repo rate by 100 bps since February 2025, reduced CRR by 100 bps and flooded the system with liquidity. All this, even as central banks in the US, China, the EU and Britain have opted to hold rates constant till there is greater clarity. The fall in inflation to a more than six-year low in June was driven primarily by FB group, which accounts for close to 46 of the consumption basketindex and can quickly reverse (one extreme weather event is all it takes). The US and Britain have seen an uptick in inflation. Oil prices are likely to move up post-Trumps threat to impose a penalty (100 tariff?) on countries that buy oil from Russia (India is a big buyer). Hardeep Puri has warned that removing Russian supplies from the market could push oil prices to 130-140 a barrel. Meanwhile, the market has been signalling higher rates for some time now, with savers deserting bank deposits for riskier forms of investment, including, yes, cryptos. In its third buyback of this fiscal year, on July 17, RBI accepted only 79 of the notified amount, suggesting market participants wanted higher yields than its comfort level. Experience has shown that more liquidity may or may not spur credit growth, and hence economic growth. But it will almost definitely spur inflation in a scenario where supply-side factors (disruption of supply chains and higher tariffs worldwide) are likely to shift the balance of risks towards higher inflation, even as our domestic-focused economy navigates these shocks better. No wonder IMF has just hiked its growth projections for India. There is also the attendant risk of banks and NFBCs lending to less creditworthy borrowers. In a conversation with Raghuram Rajan, Jerome Powell, put it well: Tariffs are highly likely to generate at least a temporary rise in inflation. The inflationary effects could also be more persistent. In a speech on economic outlook in April, Powell said: Our obligation is to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored and to make certain that a one-time increase in the price level does not become an ongoing inflation problem. We may find ourselves in the challenging scenario in which our dual-mandate goals are in tension. If that were to occur, we would consider how far the economy is from each goal, and the potentially different time horizons over which those respective gaps would be anticipated to close. To assume, as Sanjay Malhotra seems to have done, Inflation is under control, and we can assume that we have won the war...growth is good, but there is still room for improvement, is unwise. RBIs mandate under the inflation targeting regime is clear. It is price stability, keeping in mind the objective of growth. It is not a dual objective, as in the case of the US Fed. In terms of priorities, inflation ranks first. It is most certainly not aspirational growth, a term that has newly entered MPCs lexicon. We might have won the battle against inflation, thanks in part to statistical sleight of hand (base effects) but not the war. Fortunately, RBI governor seems to have realised he might have erred. Last month, Malhotras statement that though the RBI has won the battle against inflation, it continues its war against price rise, keeping in mind its objective of price stability, is a notable shift. One that suggests he, and MPC, will not rush in with another hasty rate cut. Never mind what Trump says, or the market wants.

A detailed statement highlighting the need for semiconductors, efforts of the government and response from the industry cited the crisis faced by various technology segments especially by the automobile industry due to dependency on select geographies during the Covid pandemic and stressed on the need for developing India as trusted partner in the global supply chain. Currently, countries like Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, China and US dominate the semiconductor industry. Taiwan produces more than 60 of the worlds semiconductors, including nearly 90 of the most advanced ones. Such dependence on a single region has exposed global supply chains to significant risks - from pandemics and natural disasters to geopolitical tensions. Recognizing this challenge, many countries are now building secure and diversified supply chains, the statement said.

India is emerging as an important and trusted partner in this global shift, the statement said. The global semiconductor market is expected to reach 1 trillion by 2030, with Indias market occupying a substantial portion of it. India has the capacity to emerge as a key contributor to the three primary pillars of the semiconductor manufacturing supply chain - equipment, materials and services and RD. It stated that India can leverage a strong base of MSMEs to produce components for semiconductor equipment and it has a rich source of chemicals, minerals and gases which can be utilised by semiconductor supply chain companies. Services RD, logistics and supply chain, major talent in AI, big data, cloud computing and IoT are major strengths, the statement said. The government has already launched India Semiconductor Mission in December 2021 with an outlay of Rs 76,000 crore to provide financial support for investments in semiconductor fabrication, display manufacturing chip design to strengthen Indias integration into global electronics value chains. Industry players including US memory chip maker Micron, Tata Electronics (TEPL) in partnership with Powerchip Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp (PSMC) of Taiwan, CG Power Industrial Pvt Ltd in partnership with Renesas Stars, Tata Semiconductor Assembly and Test Pvt Ltd (TSAT), Kaynes Semicon, HCL-Foxconn JV have committed a total investment of over Rs 1.55 lakh crore to produce semiconductors in India. The government under the ISM has made a Rs 1000 crore provision for Design Linked Incentive for chip design out of which it has committed Rs 234 crore financial support for eligible start-ups. The government had committed the support of Rs 234 crore for the chip design projects from 22 companies with a total project cost of Rs 690 crore. These chips will be used in CCTV cameras, mobile networks, satellites, cars, smart devices, etc. The government under its vision for semiconductor ecosystem development supports Semicon India which is a flagship event organised in partnership with SEMI (Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International). The platform brings together global industry leaders, policymakers, academia, and startups to foster investment, dialogue, and strategic partnerships. The 4th edition is to be held in Delhi from September 2-4th, 2025.

Nepal’s Economy: NEPSE Dips While Trade Tower Soars!  Loan Defaults Surge & Tourism Rebounds|Nepals Economy: NEPSE Dips While Trade Tower Soars! Loan Defaults Surge Tourism Rebounds By Editor August 3, 2025 Facebook Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp Related Tags: commercial banks loans investments NEPSE East-West Highway natural disasters Nepal-India Tourism Updates tourist arrivals trade energy independence companies Nepals Economic Digest: A Snapshot of Key Business Trends and Market Dynamics Welcome to our latest economic digest! Were diving deep into the latest business news from Nepal, giving you a comprehensive yet concise overview of the most significant happenings in the Nepalese economy. From the stock market fluctuations to government policies, weve got you covered. Stock Market Update: NEPSE Down, but Trade Tower Soars The Nepal Stock Exchange (NEPSE) experienced a dip this week, falling by 60.01 points to close at 2922.63. However, the stock market wasnt all downbeat. Trade Tower stock experienced a remarkable surge, with a 61.02 gain, its share price jumping significantly. Other top performers included Sanvi Energy, Samata Gharelu Laghubitta, and Saptakoshi Development Bank. Despite the overall market decline, these companies showed resilience. This highlights the market volatility but also the potential for growth within specific sectors. This illustrates the stock market trends and reveals the market sentiment. Interest Rates Plunge, Making Loans More Accessible Good news for borrowers! Bank base rates in Nepal have dropped sharply, making loans more affordable. The average base rate across 20 commercial banks now stands at 6.11 as of Saun in the upcoming fiscal year, a significant decrease from the previous year. This decrease stems from increased liquidity, lower deposit rates, and reduced loan demand. With all banks now offering loan rates below 10, businesses and individuals will find it easier to access the funding needed. This move provides welcome relief to the struggling economy and will likely stimulate business investment. Hydropower Projects Making Progress: Middle Bhotekoshi to Start Commercial Production The 102 MW Middle Bhotekoshi Hydropower Project is finally on the verge of starting commercial electricity generation after facing several delays. This signifies a crucial step towards energy self-sufficiency for the nation. This project has strong support from over a million public investors, and it will generate 542.2 million kWh annually. Economic Challenges : Rising Loan Defaults and Blacklisting Unfortunately, the Nepalese economy also faces significant challenges. Over 18,000 Nepali businesses were blacklisted for defaulting on bank loans in FY 208182. This reflects growing economic pressure, impacting financial institutions and highlighting issues with cash flow within the sector. Tourism Rebounds, But Challenges Persist Tourism in Nepal is showing signs of recovery, with tourist arrivals in July up by 8.7. The total for the first seven months of the year is nearing pre-pandemic levels. This growth is credited to dedicated tourism promotions and private sector investments. However, structural issues like the monsoon season and poor road conditions still persist. Regulatory Action on Insurance Companies The Nepal Insurance Authority has taken regulatory action against several insurance companies for non-compliance, signaling a commitment to improving transparency and accountability within the financial sector. This includes warnings and demands for compliance to promote better practices. This step helps in market regulation within the financial industry. Government Initiatives and Infrastructure Developments The government is taking steps to boost tourism in western Nepal by waiving climbing fees for several peaks. In addition, The Bajhang Upper Seti Hydropower Project secured a major investment, signifying a push for infrastructure development and energy independence. Trade and Transit : Expanding Rail Cargo Access A significant development for trade and transit : the Nepal-India transit treaty has been amended to allow all cargo types to be transported by rail through additional customs points. This change should reduce transport costs and benefit industries across Nepal. Disasters and Insurance : Claims Following Rasuwa Floods Insurance claims related to the July 7 floods and landslides in Rasuwa have reached a significant amount. This highlights the impact of natural disasters on the insurance sector. Industry Focus : The Revitalization of Saptaris Industrial Zone Efforts are underway to revive the Gajendra Narayan Singh Industrial Area in Saptari, aiming to attract new investments and rebuild the regions industrial potential. Agriculture and Rural Concerns : Farmers Challenges Farmers face various challenges. Millet farming is declining in Bhojpur, and farmers in Myagdi struggle to find buyers for their Akabare chillies. The rise of smuggled, low-grade fertilizers poses a serious threat to agriculture in border areas. This highlights some of the challenges within the agricultural sector and their impact on local farming communities. The quality of fertilizer is very important for crop production. Highway Upgrade Delays : Infrastructure Bottlenecks The East-West Highway upgrade project in the KamalaPathlaiya section faces delays due to tree-cutting issues. This demonstrates the complexities of infrastructure projects and the impact of bureaucratic hurdles. Success Stories : Dairy Farm Expansion and Herb Exports Despite the challenges, there are also success stories. A retired aviation official established a modern dairy farm, creating jobs and boosting the local economy. Gorkha district earned revenue from medicinal herb exports, showcasing the potential of this sector. Tourism Updates : A Growing Waterfall and Seasonal Setbacks The Rangrung Waterfall in Gorkha is becoming a tourist hotspot. However, tourism in Pokhara faces a decline due to seasonal factors and poor conditions, underlining the need for strategic planning to attract tourists and boost the local economy. That concludes our economic digest for this week. We hope this information provides you with a comprehensive understanding of the latest happenings in Nepal.

XRP eyes 20% surge in August, crypto returns to US: Hodler’s Digest, July 27 – Aug. 2|Ciaran Lyons Aug 03, 2025 XRP eyes 20 surge in August, crypto returns to US: Hodlers Digest, July 27 Aug. 2 XRP may be gearing up for a short-term rebound, crypto companies are beginning to return to the United States, and other news. 29684 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Top Stories of The Week SEC Chair Aktins calls to reshore crypto as companies move back to the US Crypto companies are beginning to return to the United States as top officials signal a shift toward friendlier regulation and domestic growth. In a Thursday speech at the America First Policy Institute, SEC Chair Paul Atkins called on the country to reshore the crypto businesses that fled, reinforcing a broader effort by the administration of President Donald Trump to position the US as a global hub for digital assets. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Friday that the US has entered the golden age of crypto and issued a direct call to builders: Start your companies here. Launch your protocols here. And hire your workers here. Backed by clearer regulations and high-level political support, crypto companies are beginning to respond, with some relocating operations to the US from abroad, and others, like Kraken and MoonPay, expanding their domestic footprint in response to the policy shift. US SEC rolls out Project Crypto to rewrite rules for digital assets US SEC Chair Paul Atkins has announced Project Crypto, an initiative to modernize the agency for the digital finance age and establish clear regulations for digital assets in the United States. Atkins said Project Crypto was in direct response to recommendations in a recent report by the Presidents Working Group on Digital Asset Markets. Atkins proposed easing licensing rules to allow for multiple asset classes or instruments to be offered by brokerages under a single license, while also creating a clear market structure separating commodities, which most cryptocurrencies fall under, from securities. Regulatory exemptions or grace periods should be afforded to early-stage crypto projects, initial coin offerings, and decentralized software to allow these projects enough room to innovate, without crushing them under the weight of litigation or fear of reprisal by the SEC, Atkins said. 99 of CFOs plan to use crypto long term, 23 within two years: Deloitte Cryptocurrency is becoming a financial planning priority, with 99 of chief financial officers at billion-dollar firms expecting to use it for business in the long term, according to Deloittes Q2 2025 survey of CFOs. The survey, conducted among 200 CFOs at companies with over 1 billion in revenue, revealed that 23 expect their treasury departments to use crypto for investments or payments within the next two years. This figure climbs to almost 40 among CFOs at firms with revenue of more than 10 billion. Despite the momentum, finance chiefs remain cautious. Concerns about price volatility top the list, with 43 of respondents citing it as a primary barrier to adopting non-stable cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether. Other major concerns include accounting complexity (42) and regulatory uncertainty (40), the latter of which has been compounded by shifting US policy. Source: Cointelegraph UK regulator lifts ban on crypto ETNs for retail investors The United Kingdoms Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has lifted the ban on retail access to cryptocurrency exchange-traded notes (cETNs). Companies in the UK will soon be able to offer retail consumers cETNs, with regulatory changes effective Oct. 8, according to an FCA announcement on Friday. The new development in the UKs regulatory approach on crypto comes after the FCA banned crypto ETNs in January 2021, citing the extreme volatility of crypto assets and a lack of legitimate investment need for retail consumers. Since we restricted retail access to cETNs, the market has evolved, and products have become more mainstream and better understood, David Geale, FCA executive director of payments and digital finance, said in the announcement. CoinDCX employee arrested in connection with 44M crypto hack: Report An employee of CoinDCX, a cryptocurrency exchange that was hacked for 44 million in mid-July, was arrested in India in connection with a security breach, according to multiple local reports. Bengaluru City police detained CoinDCX software engineer Rahul Agarwal after hackers allegedly managed to compromise his login credentials to siphon the exchanges assets, The Times of India reported on Thursday. The arrest followed a complaint and internal investigation by CoinDCX operator Neblio Technologies, which determined that Agarwals credentials had been compromised via his work laptop, allowing unauthorized access to the companys servers. During questioning as his laptop was seized, Agarwal, 30, denied involvement in the crypto theft, but admitted to taking on part-time work for up to four private clients while still employed at CoinDCX. Winners and Losers At the end of the week, Bitcoin ( BTC ) is at 113,936, Ether ( ETH ) at 3,527 and XRP at 3.01. The total market cap is at 3.71 trillion, according to CoinMarketCap. Among the biggest 100 cryptocurrencies, the top three altcoin gainers of the week are Four (FORM) at 12.96, Toncoin (TON) at 11.49 and Story (IP) at 10.00.

The DeFi investor, crypto analyst: Stablecoins are the product that can onboard the first billion people on-chain. Standard Chartered Bank : We think they Ether treasury firms may eventually end up owning 10 of all ETH, a 10x increase from current holdings. Phong Le, president and CEO of Strategy: Were capitalized on the most innovative technology and asset in the history of mankind, on the other hand, were possibly the most misunderstood and undervalued stock in the US and potentially the world. Joe Lubin, CEO of Consensys and chairman of SharpLink Gaming: We believe that well be able to accumulate more Ether per fully diluted share much faster than any other Ethereum-based project, or certainly faster than the Bitcoin-based projects. Top Prediction of The Week XRPs bullish divergence raises 20 price rally potential in August XRP may be gearing up for a short-term rebound, with signs pointing to a potential 20 price jump by the end of August. On its four-hour candle chart, XRP shows a bullish divergence, a common signal often hinting at a potential trend reversal. In this case, XRPs price has been making lower lows, while the relative strength index, a momentum indicator, is making higher lows. Such a disconnect suggests that the recent selling pressure has been losing strength. Source: Cointelegraph Top FUD of The Week Crypto hacks top 142M in July, with CoinDCX leading losses Bad actors and scammers stole at least 142 million from the crypto space in July across 17 separate attacks, with the exploit of crypto exchange CoinDCX accounting for the most significant loss. The total monthly losses represented a 27 increase from the 111 million in June, blockchain security firm PeckShield said in an X post on Friday. However, its still a 46 drop from the same time last year, when July 2024 saw 266 million taken by hackers, with the 230 million breach of Indian crypto exchange WazirX accounting for the lions share at the time. Tornado Cash co-founder faces jury after closing arguments wrap Jurors will now decide the fate of Roman Storm, co-founder of cryptocurrency mixing service Tornado Cash, after prosecutors and the defense delivered closing arguments on Wednesday. The closing arguments phase of a trial is when both sides summarize a case before a judge or jury, making their cases and trying one last time to persuade before the fact-finder goes off to deliberate. Storm is standing trial in the Southern District of New York in a case that could set a precedent for how much responsibility developers have for decentralized software that is used illegally. US prosecutors allege that Storm conspired to launder money, violated US sanctions and operated an unlicensed money-transmitting business. If convicted, Storm could face up to 40 years in prison. Indonesia raises taxes on crypto exchange sales and miners The Indonesian government updated its tax policies for the crypto industry, raising levies on traders and miners while removing value-added tax obligations for buyers. On Monday, Indonesias Ministry of Finance issued multiple regulatory updates, including regulations No. 502025 and No. 532025, which amend crypto tax rates and compliance requirements effective Aug. 1. According to Reuters, the new framework has increased the income tax on crypto asset sales made on domestic exchanges from 0.1 to 0.21. The new taxes are significantly higher for crypto sales made on foreign crypto exchanges, up from the current 0.2 to 1, the report noted.

US 20% tariff on Taiwan island draws sarcasm toward DPP authorities|By Liu Xin and Zhang Weilan Published: Aug 01, 2025 10:38 PM The White Houses announcement of a 20 percent tariff on the Taiwan region -higher than the 15 percent imposed on Japan and South Korea -has sparked intense debate on the island. Some local media even ran headlines likening it to squeezing a lemon, while many people in the island mocked the tariff as a success of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)s kowtowing to the US, expressing deeper concerns over its impact on the stock market and the islands overall competitiveness. The Taiwan regions exports to the US will be subject to a 20 percent tariff starting August 7, according to an executive order signed by US President Donald Trump on Thursday. The 20 percent levy was higher than the tariffs imposed on Japan, South Korea and the European Union (15 percent), as well as those on the Philippines (19 percent), according to Taiwan regional media. Media in the Taiwan region gave wide coverage to the tariff move, with some citing a Politico report saying that Taiwan was being squeezed like a lemon. A Politico report on July 30 said that before the Friday deadline, US trade negotiators are squeezing Taiwan like a lemon, said a person familiar with trade talks between the US and the island. Earlier on PTT, a media platform in Taiwan island, threads about Taiwans new 20 percent US tariff rate went viral, with users sarcastically calling it a great success and others fretting over the stock market and lost competitiveness, according to udn.com. Some netizens mocked comparisons - 20 percent vs. JapanKoreas 15 percent - and warned orders would shift to rivals. Many demanded to know what concessions secured the rate. Eric Chu, the chairman of the Chinese Kuomintang Party, said on Friday that the 20 percent tariff announced by the US, along with an estimated 12 percent exchange rate loss, adds up to a substantial 32 percent cost burden. He noted this is a serious setback, especially when compared to the 15 percent faced by Japan and South Korea, according to local media. Taiwan regional leader Lai Ching-te said on Friday that the new 20 percent tariff rate set by the Trump administration on goods imported from the island is temporary, and that regional authorities expect to negotiate a lower figure, according to a Reuters report. However, local media cited a report from the islands economic authorities stating that, under the 20 percent tariff rate, the machine tool, mold, plastic product, and electronic materials sectors in Taiwan are expected to be among the most severely affected. It also noted that with Japan, South Korea, and other key rivals facing only a 15 percent tariff, and the New Taiwan dollar continuing to appreciate, the combined impact of tariffs and exchange rates may force Taiwans machine tool industry to effectively retreat from the US market. The Labor Party on Taiwan island strongly criticized the US tariff policy, calling it a manifestation of American unilateral hegemony aimed at reshoring strategic industries. It also criticized the Lai Ching-te authorities for allowing repeated US exploitation over the past few months, sacrificing Taiwans economy, according to a statement sent to the Global Times by Wang Wu-lang, secretary-general of the Labor Party, on Friday. The DPP authorities negotiated with the US without keeping the public posted of the progress or terms, without industry consultation, or labor input, while making unilateral concessions to the US. Lai Ching-tes approach â pursuing independence by relying on the US â has come at the expense of Taiwans traditional industries and small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), the statement said, warning that the DPPs failure to challenge US economic unilateralism risks turning the island into a political pawn and pushing it toward a dangerous brink. The 20 percent tariff is a major blow to the DPP. While Lai claimed to be renegotiating, any future reduction will likely come with new US demands. The Lai authorities have failed to defend Taiwan islands interests, and its lofty rhetoric only masks incompetence, amounting to political deception, Zheng Jian, a professor at the Taiwan Research Institute of Xiamen University, told the Global Times on Friday. The DPPs trade negotiations with the US also expose the collapse of its strategy of relying on the US to seek independence. The so-called international support is a political illusion, and the setback in the tariff talks is the inevitable result of that hollow approach, said the expert. Aside from the Taiwan region, in a statement issued Thursday evening, the White House said US President Donald Trump signed a pair of executive orders that included increasing tariffs on dozens of trading partners with steep tariffs ahead of a Friday trade deal deadline, including a 35 percent duty on many goods from Canada, 50 percent for Brazil, 25 percent for India, 19 percent for Thailand and 39 percent for Switzerland, foreign media outlets reported. This pair of executive orders also included increasing tariffs on Canada from 25 percent to 35 percent and laid out specific tariff rates for about 70 other trade partners. The new tariff regime will go into effect on August 7, CNN reported. The sweeping tariff hikes have drawn fierce opposition from leaders and officials from various countries and regions involved, some of whom are already vowing retaliatory measures. The US is again wielding calibrated tariff threats to force trading partners such as Canada and others to rewrite domestic policies and lock in bilateral deals favorable to Washington, Zhou Mi, a senior researcher at the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation, told the Global Times on Friday. Zhou warned the move will pose a steep challenge for all trading nations. It will expose businesses to significant cost disparities and ongoing compliance uncertainty, resulting in supply chain disruptions and soaring freight costs, foreshadowing a wider impact. When asked for comment on the Trump administrations executive order imposing tariffs on a large number of trading partners, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun on Friday said Chinas opposition to the abuse of tariffs is consistent and clear. Tariff and trade wars have no winners. Protectionism is in no ones interests, Guo said.

Economic Reality Bites Trump and His Protectionist Trade Policies|Youre reading The Financial Page, John Cassidys weekly column on economics and politics. Georg Riekeles knows about hardball trade negotiations: during the long and arduous talks about the terms on which Britain would leave the European Union, he was an adviser to Michel Barnier, the E.U.s chief negotiator. Back in April, when Riekeles saw that President Donald Trump issued an order, which was subsequently suspended, imposing blanket tariffs of twenty per cent on E.U. exports to the United States, he had a clear view on how the Europeans should respond: by threatening hefty duties on U.S. exports to Europe. This was what China had done, and it seemed possible that Americas other major trading partners would join together to force Trump to relent. What was needed was for the E.U. negotiators to prepare a broad retaliatory package, Riekeles, who is now an associate director at the European Policy Center, a Brussels think tank, told me this week. The E.U. did hit back by imposing hefty duties on some iconic U.S. goods, including Kentucky bourbon and Harley-Davidson motorcycles. Subsequently, it threatened to expand the levies to U.S. aircraft, car parts, and certain other products. But, in the end, it held back from threatening Trump-style blanket tariffs and invoking the E.U.s new Anti-Coercion Instrument, a policy tool that was introduced in 2023 to deal with external economic pressure, which would have enabled it to target U.S. banks and tech giants, such as Google and Meta, which have huge businesses in Europe. Referring to the E.U. leaders, including Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, Riekeles said, They never got going on a really punitive package. At the start of this week, the White House announced a one-sided framework agreement in which most European goods that enter the United States will face a levy of fifteen per cent. The announcement said that the E.U. had agreed to eliminate all tariffs on U.S industrial goods, invest six hundred billion dollars in the United States, and greatly increase its purchases of U.S. energy products and military equipment. This is a pretty disastrous outcomea capitulation and a humiliation all in one, Riekeles said. The E.U. leaders didnt take the full measure of Trumps trade policies and what his Presidency is about. In Trumps telling, of course, his goal is to revive American manufacturing, reduce the trade deficit, and raise revenues. Last month, as the stock market hit new highs and some economic indicators were suggesting that the economy as a whole was holding up surprisingly well under his tariff onslaught, he wrote on social media. The Fake News and the so-called Experts were wrong again. Tariffs are making our Country BOOM. A series of economic reports that were released this week illustrated the emptiness of Trumps claims. On Wednesday, the Commerce Department released figures showing that during the first half of 2025 G.D.P. growth slowed sharply compared with last year. Frantic efforts by businesses and consumers to front-run Trumps tariffs by ordering foreign-produced goods before the levies took effect have distorted the quarterly G.D.P. figures, which show the economy contracting at an annualized rate of 0.5 per cent from January to March and growing at a seemingly healthy rate of three per cent between April and June. If you combine the figures to correct for the distortions, they show G.D.P. expanding at a rate of 1.3 per cent during the past six months, compared with 2.8 per cent in 2024. Thats a big drop. Given all the uncertainty created by the chaotic rollout of Trumps new tariff regime, its hardly surprising that employers have been thinking twice about hiring workers. The official employment report for June, which was released a month ago, showed weakness in many private-sector industries, but the over-all scale of the slowdown wasnt clear until the July report came out, on Friday. Leaving aside seasonal farm labor, employers created seventy-three thousand new positions last month, a smaller number than Wall Street was expecting. But the real shocker came in the revised estimates for May and June, which showed that job growth fell to below twenty thousand in each month. That amounts to a virtual standstill. Taking the last three months as a whole, employment growth has been weaker than in any comparable period since the covid -19 pandemic. Trumps initial response to the jobs report was to renew his attacks on the Federal Reserve, and its chair, Jerome Powell, for not acceding to his demands for a cut in interest rates. Powell is a disaster, he wrote on Truth Social immediately after the job figures were released. Later in the day, again on Truth Social, Trump announced that he was firing the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which produces the monthly employment report. In another post, he sought to justify this unprecedented step by claiming that the July job figures had been rigged to make him and other Republicans look bad. The reality is that the B.L.S. is staffed by statisticians and other data experts, many of them career public servants, who go to great lengths to produce accurate figures. Even by his standards, Trumps effort to find a scapegoat was pretty pathetic. As for the Fed, which held its benchmark interest rate steady at a policy meeting earlier this week, it isnt responsible for the fact that many firms are responding to Trumps tariffs by holding off on hiring and starting to raise their prices. Another economic report released this week showed the rate of inflation, as captured by the Feds preferred metric, edged up to 2.6 per cent in June, from 2.4 per cent in May. That means inflation is still above the Feds two-per-cent target, and it points to a possible return of stagflation, in which price rises accelerate at the same time that the economy stagnates. At times, Trump and his economic advisers have suggested that it may be a worthwhile trade-off for the economy to suffer some short-term pain in exchange for raising tariffs and bringing down the trade deficit, which in four of the past five years has totalled more than three per cent of G.D.P. Although this argument seems to make some intuitive sense, its hard to back up empirically. The data shows there is just no relationship between trade balances and tariffs. Joseph Gagnon, an economist at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, in Washington, told me. The Trump policy agenda is based on a mistaken premise, Gagnon added. One way that Trumps tariffs could bring down the trade deficit, which is the gap between exports and imports, is by eventually knocking the economy into a full-on recession. But, if this happens, the narrowing in the gap wont have anything to do with removing foreign trade barriers: it will be because American consumers and businesses have less money to spend on everything, imported goods included. As Americans wait nervously to see whether this is the future awaiting them, many people in other countries are coming to terms with a world in which the U.S. government has transitioned from acting as the principal guarantor of an open trading system to operating what is essentially a global protection racket. This is about coercion and coercive bargaining, Riekeles said. The U.S. Administration is pursuing an approach that doesnt take account of any rules, or prior commitments, but is purely based on might. Might is right. If you can get something by exerting pressure, then do it. If you are not willing to exert counter-pressure, you are going to end up being weak and bullied. Under a series of executive orders that Trump signed this week, levies ranging from ten per cent to fifty per cent will be imposed on goods from scores of nations, beginning next Thursday. As is only to be expected, most of the coverage of Trump trade policies focussed on major U.S. trading partners, such as Canada, Mexico, Japan, India, and the E.U. But the list of places whose products will be subjected to tariffs include poverty-stricken Chad and Lesotho; Laos and Iraq, two countries that have surely suffered enough in the past from U.S. actions, will face respective tariffs of forty per cent and thirty-five per cent. From an economic and business perspective, the fact that the new tariff regime is so complicatedvastly different rates across countries, with exemptions for certain goodsis an additional burden. But from Trumps Mafia-boss perspective it is a feature rather than a bug, because it allows him to reward and punish individual nations and industries based on his political whims. Thus, coffee and many other goods from Brazil, which has incurred his wrath by indicting his fellow-strongman Jair Bolsonaro, will be hit with duties of fifty per cent, but Brazilian iron ore, which the politically powerful U.S. steel industry relies on, will be exempted. After Canada announced this week that it supported Palestinian statehood, Trump wrote on Truth Social, That will make it very hard for us to make a Trade Deal with them. Another novel feature of the deals that the Trump Administration has made is that, under duress, Japan and the E.U. pledged to invest hundreds of billions of dollars in the United States. Evidently, Trump is using the same playbook with which he bullied universities and law firms by threatening to withhold federal funding and contracts. There is also a historical analogy. The new Trumpian trade regime, featuring tribute transfers to the hegemon as well as high tariff walls, resembles the extractive economic policies of the Ming dynasty more than the open trade order to which American Presidents from Harry Truman to Barack Obama pledged fealty. In Europe, we still have the habit of thinking of the U.S. as a friend and ally, Riekeles quipped. Trump is helping many non-Americans to break this habit. At home, meanwhile, he is resorting to the actions of a petty dictator by attacking the independent central bank and firing an economic scorekeeper. If he persists with this strategy, it will further undermine the credibility and strength of the U.S. economy, but it surely wont enable him to disguise the consequences of his policies. They are already becoming clearer.

Jane Street under I-T scanner in India; probe hits roadblock over non-cooperation|The Income Tax Department s ongoing verification proceedings against US proprietary trading firm Jane Street have hit a hurdle, with the company allegedly refusing to cooperate with investigators, officials familiar with the matter said. The tax department had sought access to data and servers used by Jane Street, but the firm refused to cooperate claiming that the servers were located outside India, these officials told ET. Productivity Tool Zero to Hero in Microsoft Excel: Complete Excel guide By Metla Sudha Sekhar Finance Introduction to Technical Analysis Candlestick Theory By Dinesh Nagpal Finance Financial Literacy i e Lets Crack the Billionaire Code By CA Rahul Gupta Digital Marketing Digital Marketing Masterclass by Neil Patel By Neil Patel Finance Technical Analysis Demystified- A Complete Guide to Trading By Kunal Patel Productivity Tool Excel Essentials to Expert: Your Complete Guide By Study at home Artificial Intelligence AI For Business Professionals Batch 2 By Ansh Mehra Their servers are located offshore, and access is being denied. The books of accounts are also maintained outside India, despite legal requirements under Indian company law to maintain them domestically, said a senior tax official, requesting anonymity. The company has only skeleton staff in India, and they too have not been cooperating, the official added. Jane Street did not respond to an email seeking comment till press time Friday. Given the lack of cooperation, the department on Thursday carried out a survey action at the Mumbai offices of Nuvama Wealth Management, which is Jane Streets on-ground trading partner in India. Certain documents and electronic evidence have been seized and are being examined, a senior official said. Live Events In a filing with stock exchanges, Nuvama confirmed the departments survey and said it is extending full co-operation with the authorities. The income tax department is also examining possible violations of the General Anti-Avoidance Rules (GAAR) and permanent establishment regulations by the company. Under GAAR, the tax department can disregard any arrangement lacking commercial substance or structured primarily to avoid tax. It is also probing whether the firm has created a fixed place of business in India, which gives rise to tax liabilities. This development comes in the wake of the regulatory scrutiny of the companys operations in India. The Securities and Exchange Board of India on July 3 barred Jane Street from accessing capital markets, alleging that it made illegal gains of Rs 4,843.5 crore by manipulating trades in Bank Nifty and Nifty Index Options. The regulator also directed it to deposit the gains into an interest-bearing escrow account. Sebi lifted the trading ban on July 21 after Jane Street deposited Rs 4,840 crore in an escrow account while clarifying that this action would not affect or limit its legal rights or remedies. The regulator allowed the firm to resume trading, but under close monitoring. According to Sebi, its investigation found that while Jane Streets Indian entity executed intraday trades in the cash segment, its offshore arms-particularly in Singapore and Hong Kong-booked large profits through index options. Jane Street has denied allegations of market manipulation. (You can now
Central banks are building a haven of bullion assets|MUMBAI: Central bank gold appetite, although not as voracious as the 1,000-tonne-a-year purchases in the past three calendar years, remains largely undiminished globally as this group of institutional buyers diversifies its asset base beyond the customary dollar-denominated holdings in a world increasingly strewn with tariff snags. Central banks net bought 166 tonnes of gold in three months to June, 33 lower quarter-on-quarter, World Gold Council (WGC) data showed. While this is the lowest quarterly number since June 2022, it is 41 higher than the average quarterly level seen between 2010 and 2021, before buying ramped up sharply in more recent years, WGC data showed. Productivity Tool Zero to Hero in Microsoft Excel: Complete Excel guide By Metla Sudha Sekhar Finance Introduction to Technical Analysis Candlestick Theory By Dinesh Nagpal Finance Financial Literacy i e Lets Crack the Billionaire Code By CA Rahul Gupta Digital Marketing Digital Marketing Masterclass by Neil Patel By Neil Patel Finance Technical Analysis Demystified- A Complete Guide to Trading By Kunal Patel Productivity Tool Excel Essentials to Expert: Your Complete Guide By Study at home Artificial Intelligence AI For Business Professionals Batch 2 By Ansh Mehra For the first half (H1) of 2025, the number stood at 415 tonnes compared to 525 tonnes in year ago. This is also the lowest first half since 2022. Elevated gold prices amid destabilising economic and geopolitical environment has likely contributed to the slowdown in central bank buying, WGC said. According to Madhavankutty G, chief economist at Canara Bank, the central banks gold purchases fit perfectly into the de-dollarisation theme, where countries want to diversify their foreign exchange reserves. Though the dollar is still dominant in FX reserves, its share is coming down drastically, with gold benefiting from this shift. The added benefit of gold is also the safety aspect. The US tariffs have increased the geopolitical as well as global economic uncertainty, which in turn is expected to keep gold prices elevated. Historically, US Treasury yields and gold prices were inversely related. That relationship has broken now. So even as yields are expected to remain above 4.30, gold demand prices may also remain high, he said. Live Events Although central banks typically are strategic buyers of gold, they are not completely insensitive to its price level. But that they continue to add gold in the face of a higher price underscores their continuing favourable attitudes towards gold as a strategic asset amid such uncertainty, it said. According to WCG, the longer-term trend of central banks taking advantage of golds diversification properties and reallocating from US assets to gold remains intact. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) bought nearly half a tonne of gold in the last week of June after a relatively conservative spell of bullion shopping in the current fiscal year, ET reported earlier. The RBI s outstanding stock of gold amounted to nearly 880 tonnes as of June 27. Its share in Indias foreign exchange reserves climbed to 12.1 as of July 18, 2025, from 8.9 as of July 19, 2024. WGCs Central Bank Gold Reserves Survey 2025 revealed that 95 expect gold reserves to increase over the next 12 months. The results of the survey, which collected data from 73 of the worlds central banks, were published in mid-June. The National Bank of Poland was the largest buyer of gold, adding 19 tonnes to its gold reserves in the June quarter, while Chinas reported purchases amounted to 6 tonnes, half of what it bought in the March quarter. Chinas gold reserves now stand at 2,299 tonnes, WCG data showed. (You can now

(Photo: NDTV Profit) Show Quick Read Summary is AI Generated. Newsroom Reviewed The Enforcement Directorate has issued a look out circular against Reliance Group Chairman Anil Ambani, in connection with the alleged Rs 3,000-crore loan fraud case, as per NDTV sources. Ambani has been summoned to appear before the ED on Tuesday. A look out circular prevents individuals from leaving the country in an attempt to evade prosecution. The move follows raids launched by the agency on July 24 across multiple premises associated with Ambanis companies. The loan fraud investigation centres on loans disbursed by Yes Bank Ltd. to Ambanis group firms between 2017 and 2019. The ED suspects that a portion of these funds may have been illegally diverted. Investigators are also probing a possible quid pro quo, alleging that Yes Bank promoters received financial benefits shortly before the loans were sanctioned. In response to the developments, Reliance Power and Reliance Infrastructure had already issued statements to the stock exchanges on July 26, asserting that the EDs actions had absolutely no impact on their business operations, financial performance, or stakeholder interests. In June this year, the State Bank of India declared Reliance Communications and its promoter Anil Ambanis account as fraud, notifying the Reserve Bank of India and filing a complaint with the CBI. Investigators have since seized documents and digital records from group offices in Mumbai and Delhi as part of a wider probe into suspected misuse of public funds through a network of shell companies. Earlier, the Securities and Exchange Board of India had barred Anil Ambani and several senior group executives from the securities markets for five years and imposed a monetary penalty for alleged diversion of funds from Reliance Home Finance.
NSE Reaches Settlement With SEBI In Outsourcing Case - Details Here|NSE Reaches Settlement With SEBI In Outsourcing Case Details Here NSE settlement order comes into force with immediate effect with the regulator not initiating any enforcement action against NSE.

(Photo source: Neha AravindNDTV Profit) The National Stock Exchange of India has reached a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Board of India in a case related to storage and alleged illegal outsourcing historical trade data to a third party vendor, according to a statement by the markets regulator. The settlement amount stands at Rs 40.35 crore. The NSE settlement order comes into force with immediate effect with the regulator not initiating any enforcement action against NSE. The settlement case is related to technical auditing related issue from 2021 to 2022. The regulator has found some short comings and asked NSE to conduct internal review and identify the defaulting officers. However, the leading bourse has decided to neither accept nor deny any wrongdoings. This comes nearly a month after NSE had filed for settlement in the pending co-location and dark fibre cases. An amount of between Rs 1,300 crore to Rs 1,400 crore was offered as part of the proposed settlement, people in the know had told NDTV Profit in June. They also added that the matter remains pending for approval from the SEBI. The initial public offering of the National Stock Exchange has been the subject of much discourse in the past few years. However, it seems that the fog around it is finally becoming thinner, especially since the markets regulator has also changed its stance on two major issuesthe demerger of clearing corporations from their parent exchanges and a softer stance for allowing listing of companies with a large public float.
Sebi claims Sanjiv Bhasin 'kingpin' in front-running case|Sebi claims Sanjiv Bhasin kingpin in front-running case After the hearing, the Securities Appellate Tribunal directed Bhasin to deposit 1 crore in favour of Sebi. Priyanka Gawande Updated 1 Aug 2025, 06:07 PM IST Sebis comment follows a petition filed by Sanjiv Bhasin in the SAT. (Photo: Reuters) Mumbai: The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), during a hearing in the Securities Appellate Tribunal on Friday, alleged that Sanjiv Bhasin, former director of IIFL Securities, was the kingpin in a front-running and market manipulation case. Its fairly a gross case... The appellant (Sanjiv Bhasin) is perhaps tactically the actual kingpin and mastermind behind the whole thing, Shiraz Rustomjee, senior counsel for Sebi, said during a hearing in the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT ). After the hearing, the tribunal directed Bhasin to deposit 1 crore in favour of Sebi. In our view, the end of justice would be met by directing the appellant (Bhasin) to deposit a sum of 1 crore in a fixed deposit with lien mark in favour of Sebi, the SAT bench said in its order. Sebis comment follows a petition filed by Sanjiv Bhasin in the SAT challenging the market regulators 17 June order that alleged that Bhasin was involved in front-running and stock manipulation. Front-running refers to trading of stock or any other financial asset by a broker who has insider knowledge of a future transaction that is about to affect its price. The market regulator, in its order, held that Bhasin first bought the securities himself and later recommended them to the public on news channels, including Zee Business, ET Now, and IIFLs Telegram channel, in violation of Sebis Research Analyst Regulations. The Sebi had ordered the freezing of Bhasins bank accounts and securities and directed him, along with others, to jointly and severally impound alleged gains of 11.7 crore an amount Bhasin claimed was unsustainable and has caused significant financial hardship. Bhasin, along with his cousin Lalit Bhasin other entities, were also barred from accessing capital markets. Vikram Nankani, appearing for Sanjiv Bhasin, denying the allegations, said, How they have gone about calculating this figure, which is completely based on imagination. This (deposit amount) 11.37 crores has really no basis.
NSE reaches Rs 40.35 crore settlement with Sebi over data disclosure case|Agencies The National Stock Exchange of India has agreed to pay Rs 40.35 crore to settle charges related to the indirect sharing of confidential information on listed companies with a third-party vendor, the Securities and Exchange Board of India ( Sebi ) said on Friday, a move that could help revive the exchanges long-delayed plans for a public listing. The settlement ends regulatory proceedings against the exchange without admission of guilt, in a case that had raised concerns over governance lapses at one of Indias most influential market institutions. The case relates to multiple governance lapses identified during a regulatory inspection for the period between February 2021 and March 2022. Sebi found that NSE, in the absence of a binding contract, had outsourced storage of historical trade data to a third-party vendor and permitted the transfer of sensitive information to a data subsidiary, which further disseminated it to external clients. This setup, according to Sebi, enabled clients to receive unpublished price-sensitive announcements before they were made public. In its order dated July 31, Sebi noted that NSEs system architecture enabled it to send unpublished price sensitive corporate announcement(s) to the clients of NDAL (NSE Data Analytics Limited) prior to hosting the same on its website, in violation of several market regulations, including the Sebi (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 2015. The exchange also drew regulatory scrutiny for internal governance issues, including the ability of a committee to waive penalties without requisite approval and lack of due diligence in permitting client code modifications between unrelated institutional clients. Live Events NSE filed a suo-motu settlement application under Sebis Settlement Proceedings Regulations, proposing the Rs 40.35 crore payment and agreeing to non-monetary terms including a system audit and compliance report. A subsequent internal review conducted by NSE concluded that the violations stemmed from decisions taken at the organisational or board level, and no individual officer was held accountable. The settlement brings partial closure to one of several regulatory run-ins NSE has faced in recent years, though Sebi has retained the right to reopen the case if future violations or misrepresentations come to light. The exchange, which remains under regulatory scrutiny in other high-profile cases including those related to co-location and dark fibre access, has said it awaits Sebis response on separate settlement applications filed in those matters. NSE IPO The latest resolution could smoothen the path for NSEs long-stalled initial public offering (IPO). Indias largest stock exchange and the worlds busiest derivatives bourse has been trying to go public since 2016 to facilitate exits for several early investors. The process has been repeatedly delayed due to Sebis ongoing investigations, including a Rs 1,100 crore penalty imposed in 2019 over its failure to ensure fair access to its trading systems. As of last check, NSEs shares were trading at Rs 2,255 apiece in the unlisted market, reflecting sustained investor interest despite regulatory overhangs. (You can now

India's forex reserves rise to $698.19 billion, up $2.7 billion as of July 25|TIMESOFINDIA.COM Indias forex reserves increased by 2.7 billion to 698.19 billion for the week ending July 25, data by the Reserve Bank of India showed on Friday. Previously, Indias forex reserves had dipped by 3.06 billion to 696.67 billion for the week ending July 18. Foreign currency assets, a major component of the reserves, increased by 1.31 billion to 588.93 billion, the data released on Friday showed. Expressed in dollar terms, the foreign currency assets include the effect of appreciation or depreciation of non-US units like the euro, pound and yen held in the foreign exchange reserves. The gold reserves increased by 1.2 billion to 85.7 billion during the week, the RBI said. Live Events The Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) were up by 126 million to 18.8 billion, the apex bank said. Indias reserve position with the IMF increased by 55 million to 4.75 billion in the reporting week, the apex bank data showed. Typically, the RBI, from time to time, intervenes in the market through liquidity management, including through the selling of dollars, with a view to preventing a steep depreciation in the rupee. The RBI closely monitors the foreign exchange markets and intervenes only to maintain orderly market conditions by containing excessive volatility in the exchange rate, without reference to any pre-determined target level or band.

Figma IPO and stock reaction: All you need to know|Synopsis Figma, the design software company and some of its existing investors sold 36.9 million shares at 33 each, beating the expected price range of 30-32. The price range had been raised from 25 to 28 earlier in the week due to strong demand. Agencies Figma has become the latest major tech company to go public. On its first day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, the stock surged 250. The design software company and some of its existing investors sold 36.9 million shares at 33 each, beating the expected price range of 30-32. The price range had been raised from 25 to 28 earlier in the week due to strong demand. This IPO comes more than a year after Figmaâs planned 20 billion acquisition by Adobe was blocked by regulators, who said the deal could reduce competition in the market. Now trading under the ticker âFIGâ, Figmaâs shares closed at 115.50 on Thursday (US time), giving it a market valuation of 67.7 billion. This is more than three times what Adobe had offered. On the Adobe deal, Danny Rimer, partner at Index Ventures and a member of Figmaâs board, wrote in a blog post: âThe world got to know Figma on a whole new level in 2022, when Adobe announced plans to acquire the company for 20 billion. That moment came with intense pressure and a spotlight few founders ever face.â âDylan remained his usual grounded, transparent self,â he wrote. Dylan Field is Figmaâs CEO and cofounder, and now holds a stake valued at over 6 billion. âWhen the deal fell through a year later, he didnât flinch. He turned the page and got right back to building,â Rimer added. The public offering brought in 1.2 billion, though two-thirds will go to existing investors. Most of their shares are now subject to a lock-up period of 180 days, meaning all of the current value is just on paper, and the big stock sales canât happen until January. In the quarter that ended in March, Figmaâs revenue rose by 46 to 228.2 million, while net income tripled to 44.9 million, according to a report by CNBC. Company profile Figma is best known for its cloud-based platform, which allows teams to collaborate on interface designs in real time, much like using Google Docs. But it has since expanded its services beyond design to include tools for website creation, AI programming, branded marketing, and digital illustration. Founded in 2012 by Field and Evan Wallace, Figma has major global brands, including Netflix, Duolingo, Mercado Libre, Stripe, ServiceNow, and Pentagram Design, as its customers. Top Indian companies such as Zomato, Swiggy, Cred, and Groww also use the platform. Last November, Field told ET that the company is very interested in expanding its presence in India. He said around 85 of Figmaâs weekly active users are based outside the US, with a significant portion in India. âThere is a real revenue opportunity in India. It is a myth that you cannot monetise India,â Field had said. He added that the more time Figma spends in India, the better it will be at improving its services for the countryâs users.
Nuvama shares sink 6.5% in 2 days amid tax raids tied to Jane Street probe|ETMarkets.com Nuvama Wealth Managements shares have declined following income tax searches related to the Jane Street market manipulation probe. Shares of Nuvama Wealth Management have dropped 6.5 over two sessions, hit by investor concerns following income tax search operations at the firms offices in connection with the Jane Street market manipulation probe. The stock slid as much as 4.1 on Friday to Rs 6,931.75 on the BSE, extending Thursdays fall, as regulatory heat around its former client rattled sentiment. On Thursday, the Income Tax Department began a survey under Section 133A of the Income Tax Act, 1961, at Nuvamas registered office. The company, formerly known as Edelweiss Broking, confirmed the development, stating that The Income Tax Department is conducting a survey today, under Section 133A of the Income Tax Act, 1961, at the companys Registered office. The company is extending full co-operation with the authorities and sharing requisite information. In a separate exchange filing, Nuvama said that the survey was ongoing and that it would make appropriate disclosures in line with Sebi regulations. The survey is yet to be concluded. The Company will make requisite disclosures, if any, to the stock exchanges under SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015. The Company continues to operate business as usual. The Jane Street fallout Live Events Nuvama served as Jane Streets on-ground trading partner in India and has not been directly named in the Securities and Exchange Board of Indias (Sebi) interim order issued on July 3. However, the firm has been drawn into the regulatory crossfire after Jane Street was accused of executing a sophisticated scheme to manipulate index levels, particularly the Nifty and Bank Nifty, on derivatives expiry days. Sebi alleged that the U.S.-based proprietary trading firm amassed profits of Rs 36,502 crore between January 2023 and March 2025, of which Rs 43,289 crore came from index options, while it incurred losses of Rs 7,687 crore in the cash and futures segments. The market regulator ordered Rs 4,843.57 crore in unlawful gains to be impounded and held in escrow. A Sebi investigation found that Jane Streets expiry-day trades frequently involved aggressive buying or selling of large-cap stocks such as Reliance, SBI, TCS, HDFC Bank and Infosys to sway index movements, misleading retail traders who read the moves as market signals. On one occasion in January 2024, the firm earned Rs 734.93 crore in a single day by executing an alleged pump-and-dump strategy on Bank Nifty futures and options. Despite a cautionary letter issued via NSE in February 2025, Jane Street continued with these strategies. While NSE closed its internal probe in May after a response from Nuvama, Sebi moved ahead with enforcement action. Conditional return to market Following its interim order, Sebi permitted Jane Street to return to the market on July 21, conditional upon the deposit of Rs 4,844 crore into an escrow account. According to The Economic Times, the firm met the July 14 deadline and complied with Sebis instructions. However, Jane Streets access remains tightly watched. Reuters, citing sources, reported that both the NSE and BSE have been asked to closely monitor the firms trades. A second source told the news agency that Jane Street has provided an undertaking to Sebi that it will avoid options trading and refrain from cash market activity until its strategies are clarified with the regulator. Market-wide impact The enforcement action against Jane Street has had ripple effects on Indias derivatives markets. On July 17, the NSEs index options premium turnover plunged to Rs 39,625.77 crore, a 35 drop from Junes daily average of Rs 60,605 crore, highlighting the firms outsized role in the segment. Expiry-day volumes have remained depressed through July. Even as Sebis action focused squarely on Jane Street, the involvement of Nuvama as its Indian execution partner has sparked investor unease. The absence of direct allegations against Nuvama has done little to shield its shares from volatility, as regulatory overhang and tax department scrutiny continue to weigh on sentiment. Nuvama shares are down 16 in one month and are trading flat year-to-date.

RBI likely selling dollars to support rupee, traders say|Reuters The Reserve Bank of India probably intervened to strengthen the rupee on Friday. This action occurred amidst concerns about U.S. trade tariffs. The Reserve Bank of India likely intervened to support the rupee on Friday as worries over steep U.S. trade tariffs and foreign portfolio outflows from equities kept up the pressure, five traders told Reuters. The rupee was at 87.5150, up 0.1 in early trading after opening nearly flat at 87.60, sidestepping losses in regional currencies. State-run banks were spotted offering dollars right from 87.60 levels, and most likely on behalf of the RBI, a trader at a Mumbai-based bank said. Separately, two Singapore-based FX traders said that the central bank had also likely stepped into the non-deliverable forwards market to prevent rupee depreciation. On the day, Asian currencies were down between 0.1 to 0.5 while the dollar index was hovering at the 100 mark. Live Events (You can now
Fictions of freedom|How do you politicize a place that refuses to be moved? South African authorsin both fiction and nonfictionhave long wrestled with the unique contradictions inherent in modern-day Cape Town, a city with a strong tradition of using narrative as a tool of resistance. K. Sello Duikers heralded novel of the South African canon, The Quiet Violence of Dreams, originally published in 2001, continues to find relevancy decades after its publication through his indictments of Cape Towns parallel realities, flashing a lens into working-class and queer life. For a story based in a city whose wealth and beauty dominate the public narrative, The Quiet Violence of Dreams contends with the places and people for whom beauty comes at an expense. While superficial readings of the book consider it wrapped up in the hangover of unfulfilled Rainbow Nation promises of post-apartheid, it eschews such trappings to emphasize the condition of humanity that is unrelentingly dispossessed. Duikers primary narrator, Tshepo, navigates Cape Town with candor and discontent. Tshepo finds reprieve in the neighborhood of Observatory, colloquially called Obz or Obs, along with his friend Mmabatho, who works in theater and the arts. The two spend their evenings in restaurants like Ganesh and A Touch of Madness, two neighborhood staples known for their youth culture, liberal politics, and bohemian style. Tshepo grapples with unrelenting violence in his personal life, mental health deliberations, and the demands of the city, from spending time in Valkenburg, a mental health hospital that still operates in Observatory today, to working in the upscale queer sex work scene. The Obs of The Quiet Violence of Dreams is reflected as a liberal place with semi-affordable housing and student digs, bars, and nightlight that was less formal and more communal (and where many conversations happened over a bottle of Black Label beer). Duikers Obs and the Obs of today are recognizable in some waysValkenburg still operates, as does the Observatory. Ganesh is still open, though in February of this year, it came under new management (and new menus and prices) while A Touch of Madness shuttered in 2024.What is considered petty crime still persists, as do all the factors that create it. Observatorys history of progressive intermixing that was disallowed by apartheid, however, does not render it exempt from being a gentrifying force in the city and its southern suburbs. It is a history inherent in the neighborhoods etymology Observatory gets its name in the 1820s from the British when they both took control of the Cape and established the Royal Observatory, a pertinent site of astrological and scientific research. Most recently, in early 2024, Amazon broke ground in Observatory, establishing their sprawling African headquarters, alongside a new mall, two accommodation apartment blocks selling for R1.2 million per studio apartment, and a First Nations Heritage Centre honoring the people whose land was taken and built upon. The land now known as Observatory was first stewarded by the Indigenous people of South Africa, some of which include Khoi, San, and the KhoiKhoi. The stewardship of the land, which was largely wetlands, was ideal for cattle raising as well as nomadic and symbiotic means of living. As Indigenous communities continue to reckon with the afterlives of the areas violent colonial history as one of the primary sites of division, imposition, and land theft, the infinite possibilities of fiction writing introduces new prisms to engage with these very contemporary struggles. What is often excluded from Cape Towns narrative is its history as a slave colonythe architecture of enslavement is still observable in places like the Iziko Slave Lodge, the Castle of Good Hope, and a barely visible memorial to a slave auction block on Spin Street, nestled inconspicuously between Parliament and a KFC. In the record of the Royal Observatory, a British astronomical establishment meant to guide ships entering the Cape built in 1820, the neighborhood is described with speculation: Before Colonial times, the Observatory site was probably summer pasture used by the indigenous Khoisan for their cattle. The Royal Observatory still operates today, now as the South African Astronomical Observatory (SAAO) in Obs and in another location, Sutherland, conducting astronomical research and being home to the largest optical telescope in the southern hemisphere. Observatory was one of the first places where Free Burghers, usually Germans and French who came with the Dutch East India Company (VOC) on work contracts, were given land to become stock farmers and hold dominion over land and enslaved people, courtesy of Jan van Riebeeck and the VOC in its settlement in the Cape in 1652. The Khoi and San have a long history of resisting colonial dominationmost notably in 1510, when the Goringhaicona clan defeated Portuguese settlers on the banks of the Liesbeek, where Amazon now stands. This early act of defiance challenges the idea that resistance began only in 1652 with the arrival of the Dutch. While state-aligned bodies like the National Khoi and San Council face criticism for co-option, grassroots groups such as the Khoi and San Active Awareness Group,!Khwa ttu, Ndifuna Ukwazi, and Reclaim the City continue to contest land injustice and preserve Indigenous traditions. The colonial history of Observatory doesnt just live in archives or contested heritage claimsits legible in todays property market. Even in Tshepos time, Observatory was already under pressure from gentrification, driven by demand for student housing and an expanding service economy. In 2025, that process has escalated. A one-bedroom apartment now rents for upwards of R15,000 (about 830) per monthmore than twice the average monthly income in Cape Town, which sits around R6,000 (about 330). Amazons arrival, with its adjacent mall and the construction of a new highway to support increased traffic, has only deepened this transformation. The result is a spatial logic that echoes colonial land dispossession: Land is carved up and repurposed to serve accumulation, not community. In the resistance to the Amazon HQ, a coalition of people and organizations came together under the Liesbeek Action Campaign. The campaign saw the participation of Obs residents, The Observatory Civic Association, housing and land justice groups, and importantly, Indigenous groups, including the Goringhaicona Khoi Khoin Indigenous Traditional Council (GKKITC), who sought to resist development on the basis that Observatory is unceded heritage land, upon which Amazon should not be built. While the campaign made serious legal gains and interdicts for development, the Liesbeek Leisure Property Trust (LLPT) ultimately won with both the support of the DA-run city. This group some say emerged after Amazon allegedly co-opted elements of the resistance, turning former critics into supporters in exchange for a First Nations Heritage Centre on the campus. In this perceived capture of resistance efforts, the authority of indigeneity itself is dissolved into a battle of narratives. But where Observatory continues to exclude is observable on its stretch of the main road, where an informal occupation, Singabalapha (translated from isiXhosa meaning we belong here) has been in place for six years. Initially housed in a disused retirement home, the group was evicted by interdict, forcing them and their belongings onto a patch of grass beside a local supermarket chain.The occupation has grown beyond the number of people who were originally evicted, and after some years, tents turned into structures turned into organizing committees. The encampment has become a microcosm of resistanceinsisting on central presence in a city that routinely pushes the poor to the periphery. More than twenty years after The Quiet Violence of Dreams, Cape Town remains a city of sharp contradictions: incoherent in its planning, alienating in its racial and spatial divides, and violently stratified. In 2025, Time Out magazine named it the best city in the world a title that sits uneasily alongside its deepening inequality. Into this paradox steps Amazon, a corporation known for union busting, strike suppression, and high worker turnover. Around the world, Amazon towns built on tax breaks and promises of investmenthave undermined local businesses and transformed communities into logistical nodes. In Cape Town, the companys arrival is already reshaping the urban fabric, intensifying surveillance and insecurity, and exacerbating familiar divides along lines of class and race. While no outcome is inevitable, the history of tech-driven development across the continent gives reason for concern: labor exploitation, ecological harm, and the erosion of public life. What becomes of the Amazon development once it reaches a full operating capacity, alongside the new housing development, is a story yet to be told. However, fiction offers a trap door to the demand for precision in the analysis of race that is both infuriating and also possesses no clear answers given its absurdity and pseudoscience foundations. Where theory and ideology dominate, fiction is less considered as a liberatory avenue and nourishing source material. In this way, fiction like Duikers includes the contours of Black South African life, but can offload precision onto more amorphous characterizations of the darkness of Cape Town and its reprieves. Take the way sex work is documented throughout the novel in The Quiet Violence of Dreams, sex work provides Tsepho with some financial mobility and camaraderie amongst his colleagues. He visits and frequents gay clubs and defines and redefines his own definitions of desire, lust, and connection. We are simultaneously introduced to more voices and narrators, Tshepos colleagues. Duiker pays a great deal of attention and care to this line of work, and all the musings and perspectives of the various therapists. We learn of their negotiations as professionals dealing with sensitivity, vulnerability, domination, and, ultimately, customer satisfaction. Sebastian, a fellow Steamy Windows therapist, incisively describes the worlds they all navigate, Perhaps it is no coincidence that I have ended up doing this kind of work. Where else can a girl with style and wit go? There are never any vacancies for us. So we create our own world and live in a parallel reality. Duikers attention to the interiority of each characters life and thought processes renders immense intimacy for the reader; we can understand where a character is coming from rather than simply following them around through the novel. This delicacy is necessitated given South Africas complex and ominous relationship to race and separation. The characters talk about living in parallel to straight people and white people, but there is another reality within the book, and that is about the madness that animates the landscape of Cape Town. Ernest Cole, celebrated South African photographer, documented some of the most significant moments of apartheid in the 60s, described South Africa as a country of signs. Everything has been overly dictated and backed with physical and mental violence. As such, the humanity that is altered by this kind of imposed violence is what takes center stage for Duiker, highlighting both the desire to know one another and the surrender that the process of learning even just one other person is the work of a lifetime. How do you learn lifes lessons and its magic and your own place in it when one has to be so deeply governed by the legacy of race and apartheid? Duikers characters try out these questions while walking around Cape Town, smoking, drinking, working in the theater or the massage and sex work parlor. They put one foot in front of the other as one does when constructing a life while suppressing the immense violence going on underneath your feet. While Tshepo is in Cape Town putting one foot in front of the other, the parallel reality is that of Cape Town and its incongruency with life itselfthe city is a manufactured paradise for indignity and wealth to run rampant. There is palpable tension between Duikers characters because of what has happened to them, and their histories, and current status in South Africa, particularly Cape Town. Sometimes the tension is generative and curious, and at other times, the tension is punitive and violent. These moments of collision between characters illuminate the more personal consequences of the artifice of progress and justice. And while this relational tension continues to shape-shift in the contemporary moment, in the contemporary Observatory, what seems to persist is the need for redefining ones personal freedoms, ones personal dignity, in the face of being subjected to the violent dreams of a nation-state.

NCEA changes: What led to Government’s radical overhaul, why we shouldn’t be shocked – Jamie Ensor|Analysis by Jamie Ensor Jamie Ensor is a political reporter for the NZ Herald, based at Parliament in Wellington. Learn more The Government deciding to abolish NCEA as part of the most radical overhaul of secondary school teaching in decades should not be seen as shocking or even unexpected. The overall package of reforms presented today is in line with the Governments general position on education policy and follows a string of damning reports about NCEAs credibility, including multiple briefings revealed by the Herald. Gutting NCEA and replacing it with more traditional assessments is also likely to be popular if parents confusion with the current system is anything to go by. According to the Education Review Office (ERO), about half of parents dont understand it and feel unable to help their children. The timing of todays announcement probably couldnt be any better in terms of pulling the attention away from an assortment of challenges the Government has recently faced. Although, it should be noted, these changes have long been in the works and arent a sudden attempt at distraction. It doesnt hurt to have a policy that will probably strike a chord with middle New Zealand mums and dads as the cost-of-living rebounds as a political issue and the Government faces criticism over everything from butter prices to quietly greenlighting significant increases to Crown board members fees. Advertise with NZME. The proposal does, however, represent massive upheaval for a sector that has faced its fair share of stop-and-start in the past few years and is a step away from the flexibility beloved by some in the education community. Education Minister Erica Stanford revealed the proposal on Monday morning. Photo Alyse Wright The Governments proposal would lead to two new certificates being established for Years 12 and 13 that are more structured and subject-driven than the current standards-based model. Instead of students trying to grab every credit they can across disparate standards like kids in a money booth with paper notes blowing around in the air, they will be tested and marked on their knowledge of an entire subject. Advertise with NZME. The return of an out of 100 and A to E letter grade is intended by the Government to be a clearer indication to parents, employers and tertiary education providers of a students knowledge. The package is one of the most consequential steps the coalition has taken this term and will likely be remembered as a landmark moment in this Governments approach to education. Pending any last-minute adjustments during consultation, these changes will have a direct impact on the readiness of future generations entering the workforce and tertiary education. When the Government talks about tackling the infrastructure deficit, improving productivity and ultimately achieving its prized economic growth, there are, of course, short-term initiatives to get the ball rolling. But long-term, its students in class right now who will have a lot to contribute. Prime Minister Christopher Luxon, who has spent considerable time working overseas and is known to be personally passionate about education, is clearly concerned NCEA isnt preparing Kiwi kids to be the top of class internationally. You only have to look at an OECD study released last year that found New Zealanders aged 16 to 24 had below-average literacy, numeracy and problem-solving skills. The results have worsened compared to a similar study in 2014-15. Asked by the Herald last month about possible fixes, Luxon made it clear the Government was readying for a fundamental overhaul of secondary school assessments. Advertise with NZME. Prime Minister Christopher Luxon has a passion for education. Photo Michael Craig What led to change? This hasnt come out of nowhere. Stanford has been looking to make changes to NCEA for years, including when she was Nationals education spokesperson in Opposition. The then-Labour Government announced a programme of work to deal with various issues facing NCEA. It devised new literacy and numeracy co-requisites and fewer standards to refocus students, but there were delays as the sector asked for more implementation time. Stanford believed the change programme was fundamentally flawed and thought simply making tweaks wasnt enough. After taking office in late 2023, she pushed out the introduction of some reforms. But the new minister didnt have enough time to halt the Level 1 amendments set to begin just a couple of months later. So she later commissioned a review by the Education Review Office (ERO), which found that despite the overhaul, Level 1 remained difficult to understand and was not preparing students for future achievement. It said one option was to drop it entirely. That report was hugely influential and formed the basis for discussions about what to do not just with Level 1, but the entire qualification. Stanford told the Herald last month that ERO unearthed a lot of things that we werent possibly expecting. Over the following year, Stanford received more briefings, including papers from the New Zealand Qualifications Authority (NZQA) the Herald got hold of. They warned of a credibility crisis over overused flexibility, a lack of coherent vocational education pathways and an over-reliance on internal assessments. They also showed nearly half of Year 12 students who achieved Level 2 last year did so without engaging in a full programme of coherent subject-based learning. About a third of Year 12 and 13 students who achieved Level 2 or 3 relied on unit standards from disparate subjects. Education Minister Erica Stanford has been thinking about reform since her time in Opposition. Photo Mark Mitchell A more prescriptive approach While this was happening behind the scenes, Stanford was beginning to announce reforms focusing on primary and intermediate schools. This sequencing was important. Stanford believed to address issues with students at high school, you first had to start with the challenges facing them earlier in their school life. The Government instructed teachers to spend an hour a day teaching reading, writing and math. Structured literacy and numeracy was rolled out, while standardised testing was brought in much earlier in a childs school life. The actions showed the Governments prescriptive approach. Todays secondary school qualification proposal keeps to that pattern, rolling back some flexibility and replacing it with more direction. The Opposition sees this as the Beehive enforcing one-size-fits-all and has argued the minister is moving too fast. But the Government thinks the back to basics style is easier for students and parents to understand, and also simpler for teachers. Stanford wants an overall education package driven by consistency, with the hope children can move between schools and expect the same level of learning, driven by the same assessments and standards. Whether that works out will depend on how well the changes are implemented and if the minister is able to bring those in the sector along with her. Stanford is critical of how reforms were being rolled out under Labour, though Chris Hipkins current Labour leader and former Education Minister says they were disrupted by factors such as Covid-19. He believes Labours work provided insights into NCEAs issues. Labours main point of concern on Monday was not directed at the substance of the proposed changes, but instead around the uncertainty caused and ensuring teachers, parents and others had an appropriate period to share their views. The Post-Primary Teachers Association responded to the proposal by saying while no system is perfect, the current one has clear advantages over the previous qualification and no changes should be made for changes sake or political legacy. The lack of adequate support for, and political flip-flopping on, NCEA means teachers are left trying to fill the gaps. We need stability and certainty. Consultation will take place over the next six weeks, while any new qualification wont be introduced until the end of the decade.

Property boom prompts surge in Australian millionaires to global high|Property boom prompts surge in Australian millionaires to global high By Audrey Courty Topic: Business, Economics and Finance Mon 4 Aug Monday 4 August Mon 4 Aug 2025 at 5:09am One in 10 Australians are now millionaires in US dollar terms. ( ABC News: David Maguire ) In short: Recent surges in property values have boosted the number of Australian millionaires to a global high, according to a report from Swiss bank UBS. Australia now has the second-highest median wealth in the world at US268,000 (411,000), beaten only by Europes Luxembourg. But the proportion of wealth held in cash and deposits is the lowest in Australia at just above 10 per cent. A growing number of everyday Australians now boast a seven-figure net worth that was once the domain of celebrities and CEOs, according to a global report from Swiss bank UBS. Much of the surge in wealth is tied to Australias property market, with the nations households collectively owning nearly 10.5 trillion in residential land and dwellings. The 2025 UBS Global Wealth Report found one in 10 Australians have become millionaires in US dollar terms (1.55 million) amid the pronounced wealth growth experienced by those in the middle bands. Thats a total of 1.9 million people out of Australias 25.8 million population, and UBS expects this figure to grow by more than 20 per cent by 2028 the equivalent to an increase of roughly 400,000 people. Australia currently has the second-highest median wealth in the world at US268,000 (411,000), beaten only by Europes Luxembourg. Meanwhile, Australia ranks fifth out of 56 countries based on its average wealth per adult at US620,000 (952,000). But it is not all private jets and champagne for the countrys newly minted millionaires, with the majority of Australias wealth concentrated into non-financial assets. Australia stands out for its real estate that makes up almost 53 per cent of the countrys personal wealth, ahead of the United Kingdom and far ahead of other markets, the UBS report said. The proportion of wealth held in cash and deposits is the lowest in Australia at just above 10 per cent, only half as much as in Switzerland, Singapore and the UK. The average price of a house in Australia exceeded 1 million in the March quarter, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. UBS defines wealth as the value of financial assets plus real assets owned by households, minus their debts. It also includes superannuation and private pension funds. While the world once again became richer in 2024, the United States and mainland China were home to over half of the entire personal wealth present in the study. The other 54 countries shared the remaining 46 per cent of the worlds wealth. Strong financial markets, combined with a large population and a stable currency, are what drove North Americas wealth growth last year, according to the report. The US was also the country that hosted the largest number of millionaires around the world by far. It counted almost 24 million of them, which is equivalent to 39.7 per cent of the worlds total. That is over four times as many as the number two, mainland China, and more than the latter, France, the UK, Germany, Canada, Japan and Australia put together. Though, per capita, UBS found the highest density of millionaires was in Switzerland and Luxembourg. A tale of two halves The worlds expanding ranks of millionaires come as the gulf between rich and poor widens. UBS found a significant gap in wealth per adult persists between North America and Oceania on the one hand, and the worlds other sub-regions on the other. Even within the millionaire category, a distinct sub-group has emerged: the Everyday Millionaires with investable assets of between US1 million and US5 million. Their numbers have more than quadrupled since 2000, according to UBS analysis, about 52 million globally by the end of last year, and they now control about 107 trillion in total wealth. This growth was largely fuelled by rising real estate prices and exchange rate effects, the report said. Meanwhile, at the apex of the pyramid, the number of billionaires increased from 2023, reaching 2,891 people. Most of these billionaires possess fortunes between US1 billion and US49 billion, with only a marginal 31 individuals holding more than US50 billion. Compared to other countries, Australia ranks highly for the balanced distribution of wealth, with the top 10 per cent holding 44 per cent of the nations wealth. Still, Australias reliance on property has been one of the largest contributors of wealth inequality, according to Finders Wealth Building Report for 2024. Close to 16 per cent of households with more than 100,000 in combined income own two or more properties, as opposed to just 6 per cent of households with between 50,000 and 100,000 owning two or more properties. This disparity was also observed in Australia on a generational scale, with 10 per cent of baby boomers and 13 per cent of gen X respondents owning two or more properties, as opposed to only 5 per cent of gen Z of people surveyed. A similar generational divide also emerged in UBSs analysis of the US and United Kingdom. The Swiss banks findings were based on data from the United Nations, World Bank, International Monetary Fund and central banks of countries around the globe.
Justin Sun Makes History as Youngest Chinese Commercial Astronaut with Blue Origin’s NS-34 Spaceflight|Justin Sun Makes History as Youngest Chinese Commercial Astronaut with Blue Origins NS-34 Spaceflight By: Cryptopolitan Media Updated: August 4 2025 5:01 AM Geneva, Switzerland August 3, 2025 Justin Sun, founder of TRON, successfully completed a historic journey to space aboard Blue Origins 14th human spaceflight and the 34th flight for the New Shepard program.

Oil prices may face further pressure amid OPEC+ supply glut: Seth R Freeman|ETMarkets.com So, in many ways we really have to look at the after Labour Day period to get a better sense. There is an expectation of lower oil prices and the logic I was reading about Indias position on not changing its oil purchases from Russia in response to the tariff announcement and the explanation that India was somehow helping keep prices stable by absorbing lower priced oil from Russia, I found that very interesting, says, Seth R Freeman, GlassRatner Advisory. Now, the US has experienced a very volatile past week and it has historically been a difficult week for US stocks. Now going forward, how should the street prep for this kind of volatility and do you expect this spillover to continue for the Indian markets as well? Seth R Freeman: Well, the combination of the adjustments in labour market statistics plus the tariffs plus political news is going to definitely at least maintain if not increase volatility particularly as I have mentioned previously volumes are relatively low because of the summer vacation which can really move the market disproportionately. So, in many ways we really have to look at the after Labour Day period to get a better sense. Also wanted your thoughts on the oil market because of the OPEC plus outcome. It was largely on expected lines, but supply is likely to increase in the global market. Do you expect further pressure on oil especially from the kind of levels that we are seeing, currently it is at 68, 69 per barrel. Could it fall further especially because of supply glut that we are expecting for the rest of this calendar year? Seth R Freeman: There is an expectation of lower oil prices and the logic I was reading about Indias position on not changing its oil purchases from Russia in response to the tariff announcement and the explanation that India was somehow helping keep prices stable by absorbing lower priced oil from Russia, I found that very interesting.

India's AI boom hides dependency risks under Trump deregulation|Indias AI boom hides dependency risks under Trump deregulation Prasanth Aby Thomas, DIGITIMES, Bangalore Monday 4 August 2025 0 Credit: AFP India may benefit in the short term from a renewed US push to ease restrictions on artificial intelligence exports, but the shift could deepen its long-term reliance on American chipmakers and AI technology providers, analysts say. Quick gains, lasting dependencies The Trump administration released its AI Action Plan on July 23, 2025, following Executive Order 14179 issued in January 2025. The order directed officials to draft a strategy to strengthen US leadership in artificial intelligence and reduce regulatory barriers. In the short-term three to five-year period, Trumps AI Action Plan supports the AI infrastructure and AI-for-everyone growth across Asia, including India, with easy access supported by deregulation, said Dr. Danish Faruqui, CEO of Fab Economics, a US-based boutique semiconductor fabOSAT greenfield projects advisory and datacenter investment advisory firm. However, he warned that India and other Asian nations could return to pre-2020 levels of reliance on US-based companies for critical AI infrastructure. In the longer term 7 to 10 years effect, it dampens the urgency for developing domestic solutions for AI chip design, architectures, semiconductors, connectivity solutions, LLM and other components across the AI value chain, as all Asian nations like in the pre-2020 era would now after five years again be reliant on US headquartered AI players for AI infrastructure needs that serve as AI led growth vision for every nation, he said. US chip exports set to resume The AI Action Plan marks a reversal in US policy, lifting restrictions on AI semiconductor exports that were imposed through executive orders during the Biden administration. Key US-headquartered players like AI hardware companies Nvidia, AMD, Intel, Micron, and Seagate are now cleared to ship to Asian countries the previously sanctioned products, such as AI chip products across compute, networking, memory, and storage components of datacenter infrastructure, including Nvidia H20, AMD MI 308, Intel Gaudi, and Microns HBM3E, Faruqui said. According to Fab Economics proprietary modeling, this change could drive major growth in AI datacenter infrastructure across the region. The Asian datacenter business growth from 2025 to 2029 holds potential for over US1.2 trillion of AI chip consumption across compute, networking, memory, and storage, driven by over 30 GW of AI infrastructure projects, including announced, ground-breaking, and speculative projects based on policy announcements. This growth is mostly captured by US-headquartered AI players, culminating in over US345 billion in cumulative annual revenue growth for US players, he said. Indias trillion-dollar crossroads India has laid out a US10 trillion economic vision centered around AI-led growth. But that goal depends heavily on scaling up AI infrastructure, most of which still relies on imports from US firms. Indias US10 trillion economic vision is predicated on AI-led growth, which in turn relies on domestic AI hardware infrastructure scale-up to drive AI use cases across public, enterprise, and individual levels, Faruqui said. AI hardware infrastructure supply currently needs to be imported in India, which is mostly produced by US-headquartered AI value chain players across compute, networking, memory, connectivity, and storage datacenter infrastructure components like Nvidia, AMD, Intel, Micron, and Seagate. To avoid over-reliance, Fab Economics advises India to rethink its AI infrastructure investment policy and simultaneously pursue domestic capability building. Specifically for India, this is a seize-it-all moment, as it competes for AI infrastructure, domestic and FDI-based projects with other Asian countries, he said. India must recalibrate and develop an AI datacenter investment policy amidst recent changes, one that is attractive globally and meets all success factors required for AI infrastructure site selection and setup, Faruqui added. In parallel, India must focus on aggressive development of domestic AI hardware and software stack components by garnering support from both US and non-US partners, though treading carefully to balance geopolitical guardrails on AI technology to ensure sustained access. The balancing act ahead Indias AI strategy now stands at a pivotal juncture. While deregulation under Trumps AI Action Plan opens the door to faster infrastructure growth through access to high-performance US chips, it also risks reinforcing external dependencies that could limit the countrys ability to shape its own AI future. The influx of foreign technology, though beneficial in the short term, may reduce the urgency for investing in homegrown semiconductor and AI stack development. To mitigate this, policymakers must pursue a dual-track approach that involves welcoming foreign investment while also advancing domestic capabilities at speed. By recalibrating its AI datacenter policies and fostering partnerships with both US and non-US players, India can position itself as a competitive and self-reliant hub for AI innovation without compromising long-term resilience.

Rs 66,000 crore gone! LIC portfolio takes a hit in July as bluechip stocks crash|Two Sharp with ET: Retail investors trigger Nifty shakeout, LIC hit big ED heat on Anil Ambani A brutal sell-off in some of Indias most storied bluechip stocks ripped a staggering Rs 66,000 crore from the Life Insurance Corporation of India s ( LIC ) vast equity portfolio in July. The market carnage, which saw titans like Reliance Industries (RIL), TCS, Axis Bank and HCL Technologies suffer up to double-digit declines, dealt a significant blow to the nations largest institutional investor, underscoring the fierce headwinds that rattled markets last month. The value of LICs mammoth portfolio, which stood at Rs 15.94 lakh crore at the end of June 2025, plummeted by 4.15 to Rs 15.28 lakh crore in July. This sharp erosion highlights the vulnerability of even the most seasoned investor to market volatility, as a sea of red ink washed over its holdings. The calculations are based on LICs declared shareholding pattern for June, and the actual figures may have varied based on any trading activity by the insurer in July.

Chinese university students told to spy on classmates, report says|Chinese university students told to spy on classmates, report says 1 day ago Nathan Standley Education reporter Getty Images Chinese students at UK universities are being pressured to spy on their classmates in an attempt to suppress the discussion of issues that are sensitive to the Chinese government, a new report suggests. The UK-China Transparency (UKCT) think tank says its survey of academics in China studies also highlighted reports of Chinese government officials warning lecturers to avoid discussing certain topics in their classes. It comes days after a new law came into force placing more responsibility on universities to uphold academic freedom and free speech. The Chinese embassy in London called the report groundless and absurd, adding that China respects freedom of speech in the UK and elsewhere. The regulator, the Office for Students (OfS), says freedom of speech and academic freedom are fundamental to higher education. The new legislation, which came into force last week, says universities should do more to actively promote academic freedom and freedom of speech, including in cases where institutions have agreements in place with other countries. Universities could be fined millions if they fail to do so, the OfS has said. However, the UKCT report says some universities are reluctant to address the issue of Chinese interference because of their financial reliance on Chinese student fees. Be ready to be shocked and offended at university, students told Students want free-speech clarity but universities fear catch-22 The report alleges that some Chinese academics involved in sensitive research had been denied visas by the Chinese government, while others said family members back in China had been harassed or threatened because of their work in the UK. Those sensitive topics can range from science and tech to politics and humanities, the report says, such as alleged ethnic cleansing in Chinas Xinjiang region, the outbreak of Covid or the rise of Chinese technology companies. Some academics reported intimidation by visiting scholars or other Chinese officials, as well as by staff at Confucius Institutes. These are partnership organisations operating at several UK universities, which bring together institutions in the UK and China, as well as a Chinese government agency which provides funding. They promote Chinese culture and language on UK campuses, but have been criticised over alleged ties to the Chinese Communist Party. OfS chief executive Susan Lapworth previously said she expected Confucius Institutes to be looked into under the new free speech laws, over concerns that they could present a threat to free speech on campuses. The OfS already has powers to ensure free speech is upheld by universities, including against any threats from the influence of foreign states or institutions. Those powers are due to be strengthened with a new complaints system, in which university staff members and visiting speakers will be able to raise issues directly with the OfS. The regulator also said universities should amend or terminate any agreements which threatened free speech on campus, including scholarships or schemes funded by foreign countries. The BBC understands the OfS expects universities to have an appropriate level of curiosity about any such arrangements, regardless of any potential loss of income for the university. A Chinese embassy spokesperson said the country had always adhered to its policy of not interfering with other countries internal affairs. However, the UKCT says its survey responses from academics suggested some students from China had told their lecturers they had been asked to spy on their peers by Chinese officials. Other students, of various nationalities, reported being uncomfortable discussing issues in class deemed sensitive to the Chinese government, and were reluctant to pursue further academic interest in these subjects, the report says. Universities UK, which represents 141 institutions, said they take any threats to the freedom of their staff or students extremely seriously, and we work closely with the government to prevent this. Anyone working or studying at our universities should know that their rights to personal and academic freedom are protected when they are on British soil, a spokesperson added. Skills Minister Jacqui Smith said any attempt by a foreign state to intimidate, harass or harm individuals in the UK will not be tolerated. We are also working directly with the Office for Students to support universities in safeguarding free speech and tackling any form of harassment on campus, she added. She said academic freedom was non-negotiable in our world-leading institutions, adding that the implementation of the new legislation made that explicitly clear. The record 585,000 fine handed down by the OfS earlier this year has put universities on notice that they must do their part to protect these freedoms, she added, or they will face the consequences.

Pharma left in limbo as Section 232 probe drags on|Trump is using Section 232 and his Most Favoured Nation policy as twin levers in his push to lower drug prices.

Donald J Trump, flanked by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick Photo by Jabin BotsfordThe Washington Post via Getty Images Euractiv is part of the Trust Project Vasiliki Angouridi Euractiv Aug 4, 2025 06:00 3 min. read Explainer A data-driven story that provides background, definition and detail on a specific topic. Print Share Facebook X LinkedIn Mail Print Email Reddit Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Telegram While the 15 US tariffs are set to impact most European sectors from 7 August, the EU pharma industry seems to be exempt at least until the ongoing so-called Section 232 investigation is concluded. This could prolong the period of uncertainty well into next year. What effect do pharmaceutical imports have on national security? That is the question the US secretary of commerce has been examining since 1 April, following President Trumps decision to initiate an investigation using a tool dating back to 1962. The probe covers all pharmaceuticals and their components including finished drug products, medical countermeasures, active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), key starting materials, and related derivatives. The US Department of Commerce is particularly seeking input on domestic capacity, foreign supply risks, and unfair trade practices. If the investigation concludes that such imports pose a risk or are contrary to US interests, Trump could decide to impose tariffs or quotas on the affected products. During his first term, he already used Section 232 to introduce sector-specific duties a 25 tariffs on steel and 10 on aluminium imports imposed in 2018. The pharma investigation is one of several probes still ongoing, including those into lumber, semiconductors, critical minerals, and commercial aircraft underscoring the perceived importance of the pharma sector. Europes pill power in the US Currently, 80 of generic drugs and one in two branded medicines used in the US are imported. Pharmaceuticals are the highest-value EU exports to the US, with the EU supplying around 60 of all pharmaceutical imports into the States. Ireland is the top supplier by value, with over 58 billion of its 72.6 billion in US exports last year coming from pharmaceuticals. Meanwhile, 88 of APIs are sourced from outside the US, with the EU providing around 20 second only to India. Since the WTOs 1994 Agreement on Trade in Pharmaceutical Products, which both the US and the EU signed, many pharmaceutical products and the substances used to produce them have been traded at duty-free levels. In Trumps view, imposing tariffs would strengthen the domestic pharma industry and reduce reliance on Europe. I n the short term, however, it would likely push up prices undermining his aggressive push for lower prices and his Most Favoured Nation (MFN) policy. Nonetheless, the US president recently announced that pharmaceuticals would not be exempt from the 15 tariffs and even suggested that the duties could rise as high as 200 after giving drugmakers about a year to bring manufacturing back to the US. That timeline doesnt quite align with the Section 232 investigation. The statute gives the secretary of commerce 270 days to complete the review, meaning the report could be ready any time before Christmas. The US administration has indicated, however, that it intends to accelerate the process. The president then has an additional 90 days to decide on any action, which he may not end up using, since he could issue a decision once the investigations findings are released.

'Malaysia Madani: Rakyat Disantuni' needs to include mental health|Globalisation means that we need to be flexible in remaining true to our roots while also embracing the positive influences of other societies. Filepic As we are about to commemorate our National Day and Malaysia Day under the resonant theme Malaysia Madani: Rakyat Disantuni (or in English, Malaysia Madani: People Cared For), we are reminded that true progress is not merely measured by economic growth or technological advancement, but by how we treat one another. Rakyat Disantuni or People Cared For calls us to a national ethos of compassion, inclusivity and shared progress for all Malaysians, reflecting the spirit of unity, care and responsibility for the nations citizens. In that light, there is no better time to focus on an area that too often remains in the shadows: mental health. Being civilised and caring A truly Madani (civilised) nation is one that nurtures both the minds and hearts of its people. Mental health is not a luxury. It is a cornerstone of personal dignity, family resilience and national productivity. Yet, for far too long, mental health in Malaysia has been sidelined, misunderstood, or worse, stigmatised. The recent surge in reported mental health issues, particularly among our youth, the elderly and marginalised communities, reflects a deeper societal strain. From academic pressure and workplace burnout to loneliness, economic insecurity and the lingering psychological aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic, Malaysians are quietly suffering. The Malaysia Madani vision challenges us to no longer accept this as the norm. To menyantuni someone is to treat them with gentleness, empathy and dignity. It is not mere charity or tolerance. It is deep, human-centred engagement. Applying this spirit to mental health means listening without judgment to those who are struggling and normalising help-seeking behaviours, so that no one feels ashamed for reaching out. Ultimately, we should aim to build workplaces, schools and public institutions that are psychologically safe. The Madani Mental Health System should also incorporate a human rights-oriented approach to mental health, one rooted in the Madani promise of fairness and access to a redressal mechanism. A recent headline in an online news portal, Parent calls for private care home oversight, citing legislative gaps, is an indication of significant human rights abuses in private mental health facilities. This calls for the establishment of an ombudsman-like pathway to investigate allegations of human rights violations against persons with psychosocial disabilities. The time is ripe for us in Malaysia to emulate such systems in other countries if we are to truly walk the talk of being a caring society. Unity in identity As we celebrate National and Malaysia Days, we are reminded that the essence of our nation is not merely in the grandeur of our celebrations, but in the deep and enduring connection we share as Malaysians. National identity is more than a concept. It is the heartbeat of our collective spirit; the soul that binds us together across diverse cultures, languages and beliefs. During the Covid-19 pandemic, we also saw how our national identity became a beacon of hope and solidarity. The phrase Kita Jaga Kita resonated across the nation, reminding us that in our unity, we find strength. This sense of collective responsibility helped manage the crisis and played a crucial role in maintaining our mental well-being. The knowledge that we are part of something greater a nation united in its diversity offers comfort and a sense of purpose that can protect against the despair of isolation and fear. However, the relationship between national identity and mental health is not always positive. A rigid or exclusionary national identity can lead to marginalisation, discrimination and mental health challenges for those who do not fit the dominant national narrative. For example, in Britain and Australia, the rise of nationalist sentiments has led to increased xenophobia and racism, particularly against immigrants and ethnic minorities. This has caused severe psychological distress and a sense of alienation among minority communities. In the name of national identity, xenophobia has raised its ugly head in the form of hate crimes against selected minority groups in these countries. In one of the countries in our region, people have faced extreme persecution, partly due to their exclusion from the national identity as defined by their government. The denial of citizenship and fundamental rights has not only led to a humanitarian crisis, but has also inflicted profound psychological trauma on this group of people, many of whom suffer from severe mental health issues due to the violence and displacement they have endured. When identity is challenged In Malaysia, as we celebrate our unity, we must also confront the challenges that threaten it. A national identity that excludes or marginalises certain groups can become a source of deep psychological harm. The mental health impact of feeling excluded from the national narrative is profound, leading to feelings of alienation, anxiety and depression. The tragic memory of May 13, 1969, serves as a stark reminder of the dangers of allowing ethnic and religious tensions to overshadow our shared identity. Much has been done to heal those wounds, but the scars remain. Therefore, we must ensure that our national identity embraces all Malaysians, regardless of their background. The ongoing struggles of the Orang Asli communities are a poignant example. These indigenous peoples have often felt sidelined in the national narrative, likely leading to mental health challenges within their communities. As Malaysians, it is our responsibility to ensure that our national identity is inclusive, one that honours and uplifts every community within our borders. Every Malaysian has the right to be part of our shared destiny. As we look to the future, we must also recognise that our national identity is evolving in a rapidly-globalising world. The younger generation of Malaysians is increasingly connected to global cultures and identities, and while this broadens their horizons, it can also create conflicts with traditional national identities. The challenge we face is to adapt our national identity in a way that remains true to our roots while being open to the global influences that enrich our society. As we move forward, it is essential to cultivate a national identity that is flexible, i.e. one that allows for multiple expressions of being Malaysian, whether at home or abroad. This inclusivity is crucial in ensuring that all Malaysians feel a deep connection to their homeland, which in turn sustains their mental well-being. No one should feel excluded from our national identity, regardless of their location. Tackling corruption This column would be incomplete if the link between corruption and mental health were not highlighted. Corruption does not just erode public trust and economic stability; it also takes a significant toll on mental health. When people are denied fair access to essential services like education, housing or justice due to corrupt practices, it breeds chronic stress, helplessness and despair. In societies where corruption is widespread, mental health suffers silently, reinforcing a cycle of disillusionment and social disengagement. Addressing corruption, therefore, is not just a matter of governance. It is an urgent public mental health priority. I recall Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim once recited the following pantun about the true meaning of Merdeka: Kalau terpaksa dayung, kami dayung Dengan jari, kami dayung Namun, tolak ansur dengan rasuah dan rompakan Tidak sekali! (If we have to row, we shall row With our fingers we shall row But to tolerate corruption and robbery Not at all!) This years theme for National and Malaysia Day calls us to unite in our care for one another. Mental health must be a part of that care. There is no point in raising the flag and singing the national anthem without committing ourselves to building a nation where no one feels alone in their struggles. Our national development needs to encompass not only physical and economic aspects, but also emotional and psychological ones. That is what it truly means to care for the people. That is the essence of Malaysia Madani: Rakyat Disantuni. Datuk Dr Andrew Mohanraj is a consultant psychiatrist and the Malaysian Mental Health Association president.

WWE SummerSlam Night 2 takeaways: Brock Lesnar's return draws a new dark cloud to John Cena's final year|Brock Lesnar, who was named in the federal lawsuit against former WWE chairman Vince McMahon, is back on WWE television for the first time in two years. (Icon Sportswire via Getty Images) Raj Prashad Uncrowned August 4, 2025 at 3:32 AM UTC 7 min read WWE SummerSlam Night 2 crowned a new Undisputed WWE Champion in Cody Rhodes, set the stage for another unexpected showdown between John Cena and Brock Lesnar, and put a bow on the promotions two-night summer extravaganza from MetLife Stadium in New Jersey. Here are our biggest takeaways from New Jersey as we unpack how WWE moves forward from SummerSlam. 1. Cenas exceptional showing overshadowed by Lesnars shocking return For everything that WrestleMania 41s main event was not, SummerSlams was. From John Cenas monotone entrance to his actual match against Cody Rhodes, their April showdown in Las Vegas left much to be desired. After Cena promised a return to his roots at this past Fridays SmackDown, he played the hits fans anticipated for his final run. For the first time since the Elimination Chamber, Cenas titantron played, he made his familiar run to the ring and he put together his best match in years. Cena was inspired and showed he can still go as he and Rhodes brawled around the ring, through the crowd, into the Codyvator, and back into the ring. Drama lingered throughout the night with speculation around who may play a role in the finish to this Undisputed WWE Championship rematch. In the end, though, it was just Rhodes and Cena, with the challenger saluting the champion, connecting on a Cross Rhodes to take the title back and placing a certain uncertainty around the final four months of Cenas career as they shared an emotional moment together but only briefly. While it wouldnt have been a total shock for The Rock, or even Travis Scott, to make their way to the ring afterward, Brock Lesnars return wasnt on anyones bingo card heading into Sunday night. If nothing else, the decision offered immediate clarity on Cenas future. Lesnar has been absent from WWE television since August 2023, when he lost to Cody Rhodes at SummerSlam. Outside of the ring, Lesnars absence followed him being named in a federal lawsuit against former company chairman Vince McMahon, which alleges sexual misconduct in 2021 by McMahon. Lesnar is not named as a defendant in the suit, but was named in allegations that involved former WWE employee Janel Grant, who filed the suit in January 2024. Just as Cena appeared to be pivoting from what was a disappointing stretch in the final year of his career, a very different black cloud now lingers over his next challenge. 2. Another triple-threat match crushes it In a vacuum, this one was fantastic, especially as an opener. Rhea Ripley, Iyo Sky and Naomi put on an exceptional match that pushed the pace and continued to push WWE Womens World Champion Naomi as a savvy veteran. The finish, with Naomi taking advantage of an Avalanche Riptide on Sky to roll up Ripley and sneak away as the champion, was the logical conclusion for how this
Mumbai: Western Railway suburban locals to get indigenous 'Kavach' safety boost by end of next year|ANI Mumbai locals In a major boost to commuter safety on one of the worlds busiest suburban rail networks, the Western Railway is set to equip its Mumbai local trains with the indigenous anti-collision system, Kavach, by the end of next year, officials have said. Kavach is a state-of-the-art electronic system developed under the Make in India initiative that is presently being installed on Delhi-Mumbai as well as some other trunk routes. The indigenously designed Automatic Train Protection (ATP) system, which will automatically control train speed, prevent collisions, and ensure safe operations even when human error might pose a threat, will replace the Auxiliary Warning System (AWS) presently used as an onboard safety device by Western Railway, officials said on Sunday. Western Railway, which operates more than 1,400 suburban services daily on the Churchgate-Virar-Dahanu segment with a fleet of 110 electrical multiple units (EMUs), has a daily ridership of more than 30 lakh. AWS has an audible warning system that alerts the driver about the aspect of the upcoming signal, along with additional features like speed monitoring and braking assistance, an official said. Live Events The AWS panel in the motormans cab has an alarm, a vigilance button, and red, yellow, or blue lights. If the alarm sounds, the motorman must press the button within four seconds, or the brakes will activate and stay locked until the train stops completely, he said. However, according to railway officials, the AWS often falls short in preventing critical safety incidents such as Signal Passed at Danger (SPAD) and signal jumping. Its limited automation and reliance on manual response reduce its effectiveness in averting potential accidents, they added. Officials said Kavach is better than the existing AWS as it integrates advanced features designed to prevent collisions, manage train movements, and ensure adherence to signal systems. The system ensures real-time communication between trains and signalling stations, reducing human error and improving operational efficiency. Key features include automatic brake application in case of red signal violations, compatibility with existing signalling infrastructure, and in-cab signalling for safer operations in low-visibility conditions, they added. Kavach also prevents rear-end and head-on collisions, monitors speed continuously, and enables faster response during emergencies, officials said. Work has begun on the transition to Kavach. All suburban locals on Western Railway will be equipped with Kavach in addition to mainline locomotives by the end of next year. This step marks a significant improvement in onboard safety and collision prevention, a senior WR official said. The system continuously monitors train movement, compares it against permissible speed limits and signal indications, and automatically intervenes to apply brakes if needed, he added. As of 2025, Western Railway has laid out plans to implement Kavach on over 2,358 route kilometres, with its commissioning on the Mumbai-Ahmedabad route expected by the end of the current fiscal, officials said. Kavach is poised to significantly improve railway signalling systems and ensure enhanced passenger safety. Deployment of Kavach will not only enhance security in the service but also aid efficiency, Western Railway chief public relations officer Vineet Abhishek told PTI. Other routes will follow soon, officials said. (You can now
You Aren't a Product of the 5 People You Spend Time With|Jordan Grumet M.D. The Regret-Free Life Career You Arent a Product of the 5 People You Spend Time With Why purpose, not people, shapes who you become.

Identity forms from within, through meaningful pursuits and not proximity to successful people. Friends are drawn to your purpose, not the reason you find it. Do what lights you up first. Source: Pixabay Surprising_Media While listening to The Prof G Podcast recently, Scott Galloway, in a conversation about friendship, mentioned the oft-quoted idea that we are the average of the five people we spend the most time with. This sentiment, popularized by motivational speaker Jim Rohn in the 80s and 90s, traces its roots back to much older thinkers like Aristotle and Confucius. The core concept: Proximity shapes not only our character but also our success. But what Rohn, Galloway, and this eclectic mix of ancient philosophers may not have accounted for is how modern life has eroded that very proximity. The weakening of religious institutions, the geographic dispersion of work, and the replacement of in-person community with social media scrolling have all contributed to something more worrisome. We are more disconnected than ever. Which begs the question of whether we can still be the average of the five people we spend the most time with if were barely spending meaningful time with anyone at all? I believe its time to improve on this idea. Today, we are not the product of the five people around us. We are the product of the fiveor however manyactivities we build purpose around. Our identities no longer, and probably never did, emerge primarily from our immediate social environments. They radiate from within. They form around what lights us up. The things we pursue not because others do them, but because they matter deeply to us. This internal compass becomes the guiding principle for how friendships and communities now form... not the other way around. Why does this matter? The path to success, meaning, and belonging isnt paved by simply surrounding yourself with people who appear to have figured it out. That very mindset fuels an over-reliance on the same influencer culture thats leaving so many young people anxious, lost, and chronically comparing themselves to famous people online. And lets be honest. What incentive do these already-successful people have to welcome you into their lives? If theyre thriving, they probably already have a circle they trust. Are they really looking to mentor someone, hoping to level up by proximity? Its tempting to believe that being around successful people will somehow rub off on us. But in practice, that approach rarely works. Instead of focusing outward on what others are doing, youre better served by turning inward and getting clear on who you are and what lights you up. Thats where real growth begins. So whats the alternative? Stop worrying so much about networking, positioning, or finding your five. Start thinking about your purpose anchors; those deep, personal drivers that keep calling to you. What is it that stirs your spirit? What keeps you up at night? What makes you lose track of time?

From that space, youll naturally find others on similar journeyspeople who share your purpose, your values, and your passions. They will become your five people.

An Epidemic of Loneliness—Moving Beyond Systemic Isolation|Paul J Dunion Ed.D. The Secular Mystic Path Loneliness An Epidemic of LonelinessMoving Beyond Systemic Isolation There are simple ways to overcome systemic isolation. Posted August 3, 2025 Reviewed by Abigail Fagan Share Tweet Share on Bluesky Share Email THE BASICS Understanding Loneliness Take our Loneliness Test Find a therapist near me Source: Keegan Houser Unsplash We are experiencing a rampant outbreak of loneliness. Unfortunately, its not simply the result of less quality time with friends and family. But instead, it is symptomatic of a larger issue, systemic isolation. Systemic Isolation Systemic isolation was likely a natural outcome of the Industrial Revolution. In the latter part of the 19th century, relationships with family, friends, and neighbors began to lose their importance. Men experience more exciting pursuits as their relationships with machines are galvanized. We soon discover that our machines can create even more advanced and sophisticated machines. We dont need others as much as we do our machines. This new mechanistic relationship reinforces the Western obsession with individualism and self-reliance. We dont need people as much as we need our machines! Here are some of the characteristics of systemic isolation. Separation is viewed as preferable. The messiness of human contact can be avoided. Disagreements, conflicts, hurt, betrayal, and social anxiety can conveniently be avoided. Theres a pseudo sense of power in allegedly not needing anyone. Self-reliance becomes an indication of mastery, standing tall alongside the motif of the Marlborough Man. As separation is normalized, reaching out to others is viewed as inappropriate and intrusive. Theres the risk of being stigmatized as acting in violation of an accepted norm. Separation is experienced on several levels. Individuals separate themselves from by suppressing their need for others as well as their vulnerable feelings that are difficult to cope with alone. Secondly, separation occurs in families as members focus on their individual lives, relieved that they are no longer bothered by parents and siblings. Thirdly, theres separation in neighborhoods. There is a hum of compliance created by the mandate, The guy next door knows how to mind his own business. The isolation in neighborhoods infects towns and cities, until the entire culture embraces isolation. Breaking Through Isolation Releasing ourselves from systemic isolation is no easy task. Once the canopy of estrangement drops over us, we experience alienation as normal. Comforting ourselves in our insular lives leaves us colluding with systemic isolation. Lets look more closely at the steps helping us move from isolated to connected. The first step is to release ourselves from the shackles of self-isolation. Loneliness can be a herald of systemic isolation. It primarily means interrupting the denial and suppression of our emotions, intuitions, and imagination. Only through a connection to ourselves will we feel the loss of others. We can learn to move loneliness into solitude, where we deepen the relationship with ourselves. Some helpful solitude-inducing behaviors include journaling, drawing, singing, dancing, exercising, daydreaming, walking in Nature, relating to a pet, reading a book, gazing at newly fallen snow, and meditating. An old friend called with a report on cultivating solitude: I took myself to dinner on New Years Eve. The second step is inviting family members to strengthen their connection to one another. When our grandchildren were school age, we offered the family a simple ritual at meals. Each person acknowledged two qualities they appreciated about the person sitting to their right. I have also found that play is an excellent way to bring family members together. The third step is bringing neighbors and friends together. Play is also a helpful medium of connection here. We helped create several neighborhood block parties, which helped bring a sense of community to the neighborhood. Neighbors had a bit of common history. An emerging trust had people sharing tools, recipes, and dinner parties. Waving to neighbors as their vehicles passed had a new meaning. Now, the wave suggested, I know you, Im glad to see you, I hope youre well, Lets chat soon, and I hope you found your dog. THE BASICS Understanding Loneliness Take our Loneliness Test Find a therapist near me The fourth step is intervening in the isolation in towns or cities. I find generosity to be an excellent way to address isolation. You can help out at a soup kitchen or food bank, become a big sister or brother, offer a course in the adult education program, become a Hospice volunteer, or get your hammer and work for Habitat for Humanity. I was surprised to find how connected I felt to the community when I helped build a house for a local family. Trust generosity. Creating Ourselves With Others When I think of the opposite of loneliness, I think of belonging. Where I belong is where I create myself with a particular group of people. Here are some possible indications of genuine belonging. We experience a consistent welcome. We feel invited to work, play, rest, and engage. We notice that people are glad for our presence and miss us when we are away. People are curious about what truly matters to us. This might include what currently has our attention, sources of joy, trials and ordeals, areas of gratitude, and emerging changes. When curiosity is genuinely expressed, we feel people want to know us and be known by us. With a commitment to remain curious about one another and a solid trust in place, we can help create one another. Belonging deepens when we share honest and compassionate feedback. How we view one another can easily become a resource for personal development. Loneliness Essential Reads What Happens When Leaders Feel Invisible at Work Why So Many People Feel Like They Dont Matter There is ample research suggesting that prolonged loneliness or isolation involves a greater risk for cardiovascular problems, metabolic and hormonal imbalances, as well as cognitive decline. It appears that our emotional and physical wellness depends upon experiencing genuine belonging. Decide to connect with a friend, a family member, a neighbor, or a stranger in a new way. Please keep it simple. It can be a greeting, an invitation, an expression of gratitude, an act of generosity, or simply, I miss you. Share Tweet Share on Bluesky Share Email

Japan Bond yields see steepest decline in 3 months amid mounting economic uncertainty|Reuters Japanese government bonds experienced a surge. This was triggered by worries about the economic impact of the global trade war. Japanese government bonds surged on Monday, sending benchmark yields down by the most in more than three months, as concerns over the economic cost of a global trade war boosted demand for safer assets. JGB yields followed a sharp decline in U.S. Treasury yields on Friday after data showed the worlds largest economy created fewer jobs than expected, increasing odds of the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates at its September meeting. And tariffs that U.S. President Donald Trump imposed last week on dozens of countries are likely to stay in place rather than be cut as part of continuing negotiations, Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said. Bonds Corner Powered By Japan Bond yields see steepest decline in 3 months amid mounting economic uncertainty Japanese government bonds experienced a surge, causing benchmark yields to plummet due to escalating concerns about a potential global trade wars economic repercussions. This surge mirrored a decline in U.S. Treasury yields following weaker-than-expected U.S. jobs data, fueling speculation about a possible delay in interest rate hikes by the Bank of Japan. Sebi proposes tighter norms for green bond third-party reviewers BIAL completes Indias largest unlisted bond issuance in the airport sector, raising Rs 9,000 crore Long-dated euro zone bonds sell off; Trump slaps on tariffs Trumps tariffs hit India: What it means for GDP, debt and equity markets Browse all Bonds News with The 10-year JGB yield fell 6.5 basis points (bps) to 1.485, set for the sharpest one-day decline since April 16. The five-year yield fell 7.5 bps to 1.005. JGB yields are tracking declines of U.S. Treasury yields, said Keisuke Tsuruta, a senior fixed income strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities. The declines in yields were also supported by expectations that the Bank of Japan may delay interest rate hikes due to a possible slowdown of the U.S. economy. Live Events The U.S. Labor Department reported that the U.S. added 73,000 nonfarm payrolls last month, below economists expectations for 110,000. Junes job growth was revised sharply lower to 14,000 from 147,000. Ahead of a Friday deadline, Trump set rates including a 35 duty on many goods from Canada, 50 for Brazil, 25 for India, 20 for Taiwan and 39 for Switzerland. On Thursday, the BOJ kept its short-term rates steady at 0.5, and subsequent comments by Governor Kazuo Ueda were seen as dovish, as he noted continuing risks to the economic outlook. (You can now

From $0.035 to $5? Some Analysts See Similar Trajectories Between This DeFi Coin and Toncoin (TON)|From 0.035 to 5? Some Analysts See Similar Trajectories Between This DeFi Coin and Toncoin (TON) By: Cryptopolitan Media Updated: August 4 2025 1:30 AM In the world of decentralized finance, few projects have captured early-stage momentum like Toncoin (TON). But now, a new protocol is emerging with a more refined foundation and future-ready infrastructure Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Some analysts on TradingView are beginning to point toward a striking resemblance between the two trajectories. While TON gained its early traction through community hype and interoperability features, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is attracting attention due to its strong fundamentals, on-chain growth, and upcoming product suite that reflects a deeper DeFi vision. Unlike Toncoin (TON), Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is preparing to enter the market with its beta platform already in place. This platform introduces lending and borrowing protocols powered by mtTokensyield-accruing tokens that grow in value automatically as interest accumulates. Users will be able to deposit stablecoins or blue-chip crypto assets like ETH, BTC, or USDT into non-custodial pools, instantly receiving mtTokens that track both the deposited value and the accrued interest over time. These mtTokens can also be staked in designated smart contracts to earn MUTM rewards funded by protocol revenue. This adds a demand-side push for the token, as the system initiates buybacks of MUTM from the open market to redistribute among long-term holders. What sets Mutuum Finance (MUTM) apart from earlier DeFi projects is its future-proof architecture. The protocol is preparing for full Layer-2 integration, designed to drastically reduce gas costs and speed up transactionstwo of the most pressing pain points for users on traditional Ethereum. Additionally, its upcoming stablecoin will operate through a tightly controlled mint-burn system. The stablecoin will be issued only when loans are originated and burned upon repayment, helping maintain a strict 1 peg without risking inflation or oversupplysomething that aligns with the most advanced DeFi monetary models. Presale Demand Accelerates Before Price Increase Right now, the presale for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in Phase 6, priced at 0.035 per token. More than 14,800 unique holders have already joined the ecosystem, and nearly 10 of Phase 6s 170 million tokens have been acquired. Once this phase is completed, the price will rise to 0.040 in Phase 7a 15 jump that incentivizes early access. With a total supply capped at 4 billion MUTM tokens and listing targeted at 0.06, early buyers are positioning themselves for strong potential returns even before major exchange listings. On-chain buzz continues to grow, especially with two high-impact campaigns pushing visibility: a 100,000 MUTM giveaway where ten winners will each receive 10,000 worth of tokens, and a 50,000 bug bounty program conducted in partnership with CertiK. The audit has already produced promising security scores95.00 on Token Scan and 78.00 on Skynethelping validate Mutuums commitment to reliability and transparency. These campaigns are not just short-term marketing tools; they build user trust, accelerate adoption, and further amplify the tokens momentum before going live on centralized exchanges like Binance, KuCoin, or Kraken, which remain on the projects target roadmap. One key area gaining attention from analysts is the P2C lending model. For example, a lender supplying 1 ETH to the pool at a utilization rate of 75 would begin earning interest immediately. That same ETH is available as liquidity for borrowers, who can secure loans up to 70 LTV (Loan-to-Value), such as receiving 0.7 ETH worth of DAI while retaining market exposure to their deposited asset. This mechanism fosters dual-sided value: passive yield generation for lenders and capital efficiency for borrowers. It also creates an organic demand cycle within the protocol. Community Backing and the 5 Outlook Analyst confidence is rising, especially among TradingView veterans who recognize early DeFi signals from past cycles. Toncoin (TON) once followed a similar patternan ambitious vision, active developer engagement, and consistent product rollout. But where TON built over time, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is launching with critical infrastructure already lined up: a smart token system, stablecoin framework, Layer-2 scalability, and a transparent roadmap divided into four strategic phasesInitiating, Building, Finalizing, and Delivering. Currently in the Building phase, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is progressing toward the beta launch in tandem with its presale push. As analyst projections move toward the 5 mark over the next 24 months, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presents an asymmetric entry point for those participating in current phases. Early buyers from Phase 1who purchased at 0.01are already sitting on 250 paper gains. Those entering in Phase 6 are still ahead of the curve, accessing the token at 41 below the planned listing price of 0.06. For traders looking for the next standout performer in 2025, the parallels between Toncoin (TON)s early cycle and Mutuums current structure are hard to ignore. With a high-utility model, protocol-based buybacks, staking dividends, and scalable DeFi tools, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is shaping up to be much more than a presale opportunityits fast becoming a cornerstone project of the next generation of decentralized finance.

MP Oli leaves for Turkmenistan|share on: Kathmandu, August 4: Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli has left for Turkmenistan Sunday night. He is visiting Turkmenistan to attend the 3rd United Nations Conference on Landlocked Developing Countries (LLDC). Deputy Prime Minister and Urban Development Minister Prakash Singh, Home Minister Ramesh Lekhak, Foreign Minister Dr. Arzu Rana Deuba, Minister of Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation, Badri Pandey bid farewell to the PM at the VVIP Lounge of the Tribhuvan International Airport. Oli has gone there to attend the summit at the formal invitation of Turkmenistan President Serdar Berdimuhamedov and UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres. The conference will be held from August 5 to 8 in Avaza, Turkmenistan. Oli is scheduled to address the conference as the Chairman of the Global Coordination Bureau of Least Developed Countries. Oli is scheduled to co-chair a high-level roundtable as well as address various other programs during the conference. Nepal is currently the chairman of the LLDC Group. The conference, which will be attended by 32 landlocked developing countries from Asia, Europe, Africa and South America, will discuss the lack of direct regional access to the sea, the problems faced by landlocked countries and the benefits that can be derived from global markets. In view of the fact that international trade of these countries has to depend on transit through other countries, the conference will focus on enhancing the competitiveness of landlocked developing countries due to additional border crossings and long distances from major markets, cumbersome transit procedures and inadequate infrastructure, which will significantly increase the total cost of transportation and other transactions. On the sidelines of the summit, Oli will hold meetings with the heads of delegations of various countries and high officials of the United Nations and other international organizations. Without direct territorial access to the sea, landlocked developing countries face challenges to international trade, connectivity and economic development. Similarly, it is believed that the conference will be fruitful in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals in the absence of direct access, not being able to benefit significantly from the global market, not having a global comfortable network of transportation and difficult to develop infrastructure. The summit aims to enhance investment, including in strategic partnerships, to address the challenges faced by member states and help them realize their full potential. The Summit will thus play an important role in helping these countries build a mutually equitable and prosperous future. The 2nd United Nations Conference on Landlocked Developing Countries was held in Vienna, Austria, in November 2014. The conference, which took place about 10 years ago, discussed identifying international, regional, sub-regional and national and international trade and transit transport cooperation policies in terms of partnerships and opportunities to meet new and emerging challenges, including reviewing the implementation of the Almaty Plan of Action and transit transport systems. The high-level delegation led by the Prime Minister includes First Lady Radhika Shakya, Chief Adviser to the Prime Minister Bishnu Prasad Rimal, Member of the House of Representatives Surya Bahadur Thapa Kshetri, Principal Private Secretary to the Prime Minister Rajesh Bajracharya, Personal Physician Prof. Dr. Divya Singh Shah, Secretary to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Amrit Bahadur Rai, high-ranking government officials, official media persons and security personnel. Prime Minister Oli is scheduled to return home on Friday evening (August 8). Peoples News Monitoring Service.
Crypto Wobbles in August After New Tariffs Hit|Crypto Stumbles Out of the Gate For August By PYMNTS August 3, 2025 Cryptocurrency prices slid Friday (Aug. 1) following the issuance of new U.S. tariffs. As CNBC reported, this drop ushered in a wave of long liquidations, forcing traders to sell their assets at market price to settle their debts, bringing prices down further. Bitcoin saw 228 million in liquidations across centralized exchanges over a 24-hour period, the report said, citing CoinGlass, while ether saw 262 million. The dip in prices followed an uptick in investor caution following President Donald Trumps issuance of new tariffs, leading to concerns about inflation and the Federal Reserves ability to lower interest rates, the report added. At times of broad based derisking, the report notes, crypto often falls as investors sell off speculative and volatile assets. At the same time technical resilience and institutional demand for bitcoin and ether are helping bolster their prices. After running red hot in July, this is a healthy strategic cooldown. Markets arent reacting to a crisis, theyre responding to the lack of one, Ben Kurland, CEO at crypto research platform DYOR, told CNBC. With no new macro catalyst on the horizon, capital is rotating out of speculative assets and into safer ground its a calculated pause. Writing about the crypto sectors reaction to tariffs in April, PYMNTS argued that the levies could affect the blockchain ecosystem more broadly, with supply chain disruptions impacting miners and blockchain developers, especially if components like semiconductors become more expensive due to tariffs. However, the decentralized nature of blockchain technology might also provide opportunities for innovation in cross-border transactions, potentially mitigating some of the negative effects of tariffs, that report added. While Trumps tariffs have introduced significant uncertainty into the global economic landscape, the crypto and blockchain sectors are poised to navigate these challenges. In the short term, volatility and risk aversion may dominate, but the long-term prospects for cryptocurrencies as stores of value and mediums of exchange remain promising. Meanwhile, recent research by PYMNTS Intelligence examines the way corporate chief financial officers (CFOs) are responding to the new tariffs, finding that they are planning, not panicking. The only certainty that todays uncertainty provides is that firms can no longer take open access to international inputs for granted. Instead, they are being forced to rethink, retool and in many cases, reshuffle operations just to maintain a competitive edge, PYMNTS wrote last week. A more complex and dynamic model of product leadership is emerging. One that blends supply chain awareness, geopolitical acumen, digital capability and agile product thinking.

Australia's BlueScope leads global steel giants in push for Gupta’s Whyalla plant|Australias BlueScope leads global steel giants in push for Guptas Whyalla plant Operations at BlueScope steelworks, Port Kembla Reuters Reuters Mon, Aug 4, 2025, 4:25 AM 1 min read In This Article: BSL.AX -0.82 5401.T -0.36 JSWSTEEL.BO 0.00 005490.KS 1.72 (Reuters) -Australias BlueScope Steel said on Monday it has assembled a heavyweight consortium of global steelmakers to bid for Sanjeev Guptas troubled Whyalla Steelworks, over a month after the local government formally opened a sale process. The group comprising Japans Nippon Steel, Indias JSW Steel, and South Koreas POSCO brings a combined market value of A115 billion (74.4 billion), and is eyeing the South Australian plant as a future hub for low-emissions iron production for domestic and export markets. The consortium has lodged a non-binding expression of interest but has yet to submit a formal bid. Whyalla Steelworks was placed in administration in February, after its operating company collapsed under tens of millions in debt. The Australian and South Australian governments stepped in with a joint A1.9 billion rescue package to safeguard local jobs and preserve a key piece of industrial infrastructure. Australia formally opened the sale process in June, citing strong global interest from companies seeking a foothold in the emerging green steel economy. Guptas family conglomerate, GFG Alliance, was not immediately reachable for a Reuters request for comment.

In the real world, climate hawks are facing extinction|In the real world, climate hawks are facing extinction By Danielle Franz, Real Clear Wire August 3, 2025 (U.S. Air National Guard photo by Master Sgt. Scott Thompson) Once perched atop the climate movements moral high ground, the self-anointed climate hawks are now watching their influence dwindle, and nowhere is that retreat more visible than in California. Long the epicenter of progressive climate ambition, the Golden State is now backpedaling. Democrats who once championed aggressive environmental mandates are hitting pause, reworking regulations, and distancing themselves from policies that have driven up energy and housing costs. A post-2024 reality check has swept the party: climate may still poll well in theory, but not when it collides with affordability. This shift isnt isolated. Its emblematic of the climate hawks broader failure a movement that moralized, catastrophized, and sacrificed working-class livelihoods on the altar of performative virtue. And it didnt stop with workers. Families were expected to absorb the fallout higher costs, fewer opportunities, and a more uncertain future all in the name of climate dogma. For years, these activists dominated environmental discourse by demanding ideological purity. They mistook loud rhetoric for leadership, performance for policy, and apocalyptic forecasts for political strategy. Thankfully, as The Breakthrough Institutes Alex Trembath has long forecast, the era of the climate hawk is over. And the climate will be better off for it. As former allies begin to walk away, its clear their crowning achievement was turning climate into a culture war they were never equipped to win. At the heart of this shift is a growing movement that doesnt treat energy as a sin, but as a tool of national strength. Its a philosophy that values building over banning, which means restoring industrial capacity, modernizing infrastructure, and investing in the American worker. It rejects the scarcity mindset that tells people they must give up comfort, reliability, or opportunity in the name of climate so that the next generation doesnt grow up fearing collapse, but growing into a culture of confidence, responsibility, and renewal.

Instead, it insists that the way forward is to invest in the backbone of our economy, empower the working class, and bring energy production home. It recognizes the answer to environmental challenges isnt less; its more. More energy. More innovation. More freedom to solve problems creatively. Instead of forcing society to shrink and sacrifice, we ask how we can grow smarter. Recognizing that climate strategy must also serve the interests of the people, national security, and long-term prosperity, its a vision rooted in hope for the future, not austerity. And theres a policy consensus emerging. Clean energy systems need to be affordable and reliable. Rather than relying on long-term subsidies or regulations, domestic policy should be structured to encourage the innovation, commercialization, and deployment of cheaper and cleaner energy resources. This way, American resources and technology can expand energy at home and dominate global markets, while also reducing emissions. Likewise, policy should prioritize climate adaptation. We should empower communities with the tools and flexibility to manage their forests, embrace regenerative agriculture, and resourcefully steward their ecosystems as the climate changes. Our environmental approach should be grounded in the American family and national interest at the center of the conversation. Whats replacing the hawks isnt apathy. Its realism. A new generation is emerging leaders who are less interested in preaching and more interested in producing. They view climate not as a moral crusade, but as a challenge of engineering, economics, and national renewal. They understand that the future wont be built through degrowth or doomerism, but through innovation, adaptation, and strategic investment in Americas strengths. This isnt about utopian dreams or global pledges. Its about reindustrializing the nation, repowering the grid, and grounding environmental goals to serve the American people. Thats how you build lasting support and get real results. The climate hawks are facing extinction. And in their absence, something stronger is finally taking flight.

iTagPro: How iTag Pro Is Reinventing the Bluetooth GPS Tracker Market - Read iTagPro GPS Tracker Report|iTagPro: How iTag Pro Is Reinventing the Bluetooth GPS Tracker Market - Read iTagPro GPS Tracker Report Tracker Report Discover how iTagPro is redefining Bluetooth GPS Trackers in 2025. Read real tech insights, and GPS Tracker performance facts before you buy. August 03, 2025 13:33 ET Source: iTagPro iTagPro New York City, NY, Aug. 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- As Bluetooth-enabled location technology becomes essential for modern lifestyles, the iTagPro GPS Tracker is emerging as a market disruptor. Designed to help users locate keys, wallets, luggage, and even pets, iTagPro combines precision GPS tracking with sleek Bluetooth integration. iTagPro isnt just another Bluetooth GPS Trackerits shaping the future of personal item security in 2025. What Is iTagPro? Product Overview Claims As personal tracking devices continue gaining popularity, iTagPro is positioning itself as a next-generation Bluetooth GPS Tracker tailored for everyday use. Marketed as a compact, smart solution for preventing lost items, iTagPro claims to combine GPS-level precision with Bluetooth conveniencebringing real-time location awareness to your fingertips. On the official iTagPro website, the device is described as a reliable GPS Tracker that offers real-time tracking, geofencing, anti-theft alerts, and Bluetooth GPS integration. These phrases suggest a robust tracking solution that can monitor keys, wallets, luggage, or pets across wide distances. The device is also advertised with claims of long battery life, ease of use, and compatibility with both iOS and Android smartphones. iTagPros promotional content emphasizes peace of mind for users who are constantly on the move. Phrases like never lose what matters and track in real time reinforce the perception that the device functions as a full-fledged GPS tracker. The product is also highlighted for its sleek design and app-based controls, which appeal to tech-savvy shoppers looking for a practical, plug-and-play solution. However, while the marketing positions iTagPro as a GPS-enabled tool, deeper technical reviews suggest that it primarily operates via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), relying on a users phone to log location history. Once the Bluetooth connection is lost, the tracking stopsindicating that GPS functionality is not built into the device itself. In short, iTagPro is promoted as a GPS Tracker but functions primarily as a Bluetooth locator. For consumers, this distinction is essential when evaluating whether the product truly meets their tracking needsor simply offers short-range item-finding convenience dressed in GPS language. View official iTag Pro website for latest best pricing and promotions What Makes iTagPro Different From Other Bluetooth GPS Trackers? As Bluetooth GPS Tracker solutions gain traction in households across the U.S., the iTagPro is carving out its own lane in the market. Promoted as a sleek, compact GPS Tracker, iTagPro distinguishes itself through an app-based interface, item finder alerts, and sleek product design. Unlike conventional Bluetooth trackers such as Tile or AirTag, iTag Pro markets itself with claims of GPS-level precision and wider utilityparticularly for those who want more than simple proximity alerts. However, while the branding emphasizes GPS capabilities, its important to note that the device primarily operates via Bluetooth, not satellite-based GPS tracking. iTagPros standout feature lies in its visual appeal and accessibilityit doesnt require brand-specific ecosystems like Apples Find My network, which means its compatible with both Android and iOS devices. For consumers seeking a universal Bluetooth GPS Tracker, this is a major plus. What also sets iTagPro apart is its aggressive positioning through exclusive limited-time discounts, bundling offers, and promises of extended rangeall designed to appeal to both tech novices and frequent travelers. This marketing strategy has certainly helped the product trend in consumer electronics categories. However, reviewers and tech experts have urged shoppers to examine the technical specifications closely. Without real GPS functionality, iTagPro may not meet expectations for long-distance item tracking. In short, iTagPro differentiates itself more in branding than core performance. Its simplicity and compatibility may attract casual usersbut for those needing true GPS capabilities, comparisons with higher-end trackers are strongly advised. Fast Setup, Easy TrackingVisit Official iTagPro Website For More Information Real-World Applications: How iTagPro Helps You Track Everyday Items From misplacing keys to locating your bag at the airport, iTagPro is pitched as an all-purpose solution for keeping tabs on daily essentials. In an increasingly mobile world, Bluetooth GPS Trackers like iTagPro promise users a sense of digital reassurance. But how does it actually perform when put to everyday use? Designed to attach easily to keyrings, wallets, backpacks, or pet collars, iTagPro connects via Bluetooth to its companion mobile app. Once paired, users can use their smartphone to trigger an alert sound from the device or check its last known location on a digital map. This helps recover misplaced items within a Bluetooth range of approximately 30 feet indoors and 100 feet outdoors assuming no major signal interference. For close-range trackinglike locating your wallet inside the house or a bag left behind in the officeiTagPro performs similarly to competitors like Tile. The app interface is relatively simple, allowing users to see multiple tagged items and monitor signal strength for each one. However, iTagPro does not use cellular towers or satellite GPS for tracking. This makes it less effective for real-time tracking over long distancessuch as if you leave your bag in a taxi or your dog runs several blocks away. In those scenarios, iTagPro wont track location in real time once the Bluetooth connection is lost. While the product does serve practical functions within a limited range, it should be seen as a Bluetooth trackernot a GPS tracker in the traditional sense. Consumers using iTag Pro for casual, short-range recovery of everyday items will find it helpfulbut those expecting long-distance GPS tracking will be left disappointed. Never Lose a Thing Again with iTag Pro - Visit official iTagPro website Inside the Tech: How iTagPro Uses Bluetooth GPS for Seamless Tracking iTagPro is often promoted as a Bluetooth GPS Tracker, but whats under the hood tells a more nuanced story. While the name implies satellite-based navigation, iTagPro operates almost entirely on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) a proximity-based technology, not true GPS. The device pairs with a smartphone app via Bluetooth, using your phones GPS and data connectionnot the trackersfor location pinpointing. When an item goes missing, the iTagPro app simply shows the last place where your phone was connected to the device. It does not provide continuous location tracking or communicate with satellites independently. In short, theres no onboard GPS chip in the tracker itself. This is a major difference compared to true GPS Trackers like Invoxia or Jiobit, which have built-in GPS modules and SIM cards for cellular connectivity. Bluetooth has limitations. The connection typically holds within 30100 feet, depending on obstructions and interference. If the tagged item leaves that range, tracking stops until the device is found again. This is suitable for home or office environments but not effective for monitoring children, vehicles, or pets across city blocks. The claim of GPS-level performance is largely a marketing term the iTag Pro piggybacks on your phones GPS when within range but offers no real tracking once disconnected. For users who want basic tracking within close proximity, iTagPro works fine. But for seamless GPS tracking, it doesnt deliver on the expectations its branding sets. Knowing this helps consumers distinguish between Bluetooth-based convenience and actual satellite-powered GPS tracking solutions. Never Lose Keys, Bags, or Pets AgainiTagPro Now Available Online How Long Does iTagPro Last? Battery Life and Durability Breakdown For any Bluetooth GPS Tracker to be considered reliable, battery life and hardware durability are critical. iTagPro advertises long-lasting performance, but how well does the device hold up in real-world conditions? According to its official product description, iTagPro is powered by a CR2032 coin cell battery, a standard component in many Bluetooth tracking devices. The brand claims a battery life of up to 6 months, depending on usage and Bluetooth activity. However, this figure is based on ideal conditionsreal-world use may shorten lifespan significantly if youre using frequent ring alerts, multiple devices, or constant app syncs. The battery is replaceable, which is a plus. Users can access the battery by gently prying open the devices casing. Still, theres a catch: the iTagPro casing is not designed for routine opening. It lacks a dedicated battery compartment or simple twist-off cover, so the removal process can feel awkward and risks damaging the plastic shell. In terms of durability, iTagPro is lightweight and compact, but not particularly rugged. Theres no mention of IP67 or water-resistance certification, making it unsuitable for environments where moisture or drops are common. Users report that while the tracker holds up well on keychains or bags, its not ideal for pet collars or outdoor gear where wear and tear are higher. While iTagPro meets basic expectations for battery life and daily handling, it isnt built for heavy-duty use or rough conditions. The lack of a user-friendly battery replacement method and limited waterproofing may be concerns for long-term dependability. Bottom line: iTagPro offers decent short-term performance, but buyers looking for year-round resilience and field-tested durability may want to explore more robust Bluetooth or GPS tracker alternatives. Where to Buy iTagPro and How to Get Started iTagPro is currently available for purchase exclusively through its official website, where customers can choose from single or multi-pack offers with limited-time discounts. Each iTagPro unit comes with a small setup guide, and buyers are prompted to download the mobile app from the App Store or Google Play. Pairing the device with your phone is relatively simple: hold the tracker near your phone, launch the app, and follow the on-screen instructions to connect via Bluetooth. The site claims a risk-free guarantee, but customer reviews suggest that refund requests are often delayed or denied. Therefore, if youre purchasing iTagPro, its advisable to read the refund policy in full and consider using a payment method with buyer protection (such as PayPal or a credit card). As for ongoing costs, there are no monthly fees a benefit over traditional GPS Trackers that require cellular subscriptions. However, this also underscores that the product is Bluetooth-only and not a true GPS device. To get started, simply visit the official iTagPro website, select your preferred bundle, and complete checkout. Be aware of potential upsells during the checkout process, such as extended warranties or VIP support services, which add to the cost. iTag Pro Setup Experience: How Easy Is It to Connect and Use? For a Bluetooth GPS Tracker to be effective, it must be easy to set up and operate. iTagPro advertises a seamless onboarding experienceand while the process is generally straightforward, user reviews reveal mixed results in real-world use. After purchasing iTagPro from the official website, users are instructed to download the iTagPro app, available on both Android and iOS platforms. The initial steps are simple: enable Bluetooth, open the app, and press the devices power button until its detected. Once connected, the tracker appears on your dashboard, where you can assign a label (like keys or wallet) and begin tracking. The apps interface is minimalist, with basic functions such as ring device, last seen location, and disconnect alert. For users with multiple iTagPro units, the app allows multi-device tracking, which is ideal for households managing several items. However, connection reliability varies. Some users report the pairing process fails unless the tracker is held extremely close to the phone. Others note that the device frequently disconnectseven when still within advertised Bluetooth range. Reconnecting requires closing and reopening the app or restarting Bluetooth entirely. While the compatibility across iPhone and Android is a strength, the app has received criticism for occasional glitches, slow loading times, and minimal location refresh accuracy. Its also important to understand that location updates depend on your phones GPS, not the tracker itself. Bottom line: iTagPro setup is simple in theory, but may demand patience in practice. Tech-savvy users will find it manageable, but casual buyers expecting instant, long-range GPS tracking may be frustrated by the limited scope of what a Bluetooth-based device can deliver. Final Assessment: Should You Believe the Hype? The iTagPro is promoted as a must-have Bluetooth GPS Tracker, but real-world testing reveals a different story. While it does offer functionality as a Bluetooth-enabled item locator, its claims of GPS-level tracking and extended range are misleading. iTagPros appeal lies in its simplicity and price-point marketingbut the technology under the hood doesnt match the expectations set by its branding. There is no built-in GPS, no SIM card, and no satellite or cellular tracking. Once the Bluetooth connection is lost, the device offers no way to locate your item unless you return within range. From a consumer protection standpoint, this presents an issue. Many buyers believe they are purchasing a GPS Tracker capable of real-time monitoring across long distances, only to realize the device cannot perform those tasks. Refunds and customer service responses have also been inconsistent, according to independent review sites and user feedback. So, should you believe the hype? That depends on your expectations. If youre looking for a basic Bluetooth tracker to help you locate keys or bags in your home or office, iTag Pro performs adequately. But if youre seeking a GPS Tracker that can track stolen luggage, vehicles, or pets across wide areas, this product falls short. In the end, iTagPro delivers basic tracking but overpromises on its capabilities. Its crucial for journalists, reviewers, and consumers alike to understand the distinction between Bluetooth trackers and actual GPS Trackersespecially when evaluating product claims that blur that line.

The token is dead, long live the token|Daniel Taylor Aug 03, 2025 The token is dead, long live the token Crypto tokens have failed retail investors through insider concentration and poor design. Regulation and tokenized real-world assets offer hope for revival. 5873 Opinion COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Opinion by: Daniel Taylor, head of policy at Zumo Crypto X communities think tokens are toast. Heres why theyre right and dead wrong. If there were one chart to sum up todays crypto token meta, it would be Bloomberg chart-boxing its comparison of Bitcoin ( BTC ) against an altcoin basket. Bitcoin holders are jubilant, watching it approach an all-time high. Tokenholders are bloodied and bruised, seeing their holdings wither away while Bitcoin soars. With BTC dwindling to just 11.6 of an average retail investors portfolio, its been a painful divergence. This is the story of how tokens failed and why theres still a chance for the token. What went wrong with tokens The unhitching of the token wagon comes down to three well-known elements. Ironically, crypto gave in to insider concentration and almost exclusively non-public value capture. Big crypto projects of recent years have launched with most tokens reserved for teams and private backers, with only a small minority reserved for the general public. It has come to be seen as normal that most tokens go to private fundraising rounds and that a token should go through a 95 depreciation after going public. Thats not something anyone should accept. Utility and governance tokens got misunderstood by investors as passive price appreciation vehicles. People wanted to believe that passive token holding can deliver price upside when typically active protocol actions staking or liquidity provision entitle participants to a direct share in network or application value. The price charts of prominent utility and governance tokens play out this confusion and the general lack of association between tokens and equity-style revenue sharing. And thats for the minority of token-based projects with any revenue to link in the first place. Investors have been gated mainly within the crypto token market. That means no wide-scale (legally robust) access to tokenized forms of real-world assets, whether equities, bonds or any other existing asset. This, in short, is how we got to where we are: Most crypto tokens have struggled to sustain long-term constructive market performance. The great token revitalization Despite all this, the writing is on the wall that long-identified structural deficits are finally being addressed. In token fundraising, frameworks like the EUs Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) have shown how regulation can drive innovation and provide guardrails. With the proper disclosures, EU investors now have a regulated framework to participate in public token offers. This has spurred a wave of general access token fundraising projects that seek to revitalize the best of the initial coin offering spirit: open public access to early investment opportunities based on merit, not connections, regulatory exclusion or privileged position. In token structuring, emerging regulatory clarity around the expectations on token issuers sets the stage for better quality assets. Related: Real-world asset tokens are the new ETFs CoinFund president Token designs that have shied away from providing tangible investor value have often been shaped by regulatory ambiguities and the desire not to be caught by traditional investment regulation. As the UKs emerging approach to token offerings shows, however, regulation is now coming to the crypto token, regardless. Whether you offer an unbacked crypto asset or a more security-style token doesnt matter. The concepts applied asset dealing authorizations, market abuse controls, investor information documents and insider disclosures are the same for all. Burden and necessary adaptation aside, this is a long-term good thing. Tokens can be designed from the outset to capture holder value. More than that, doing anything else will no longer be a choice. Rigorous token disclosures will soon expose rigged tokenomics. And exhaustive due diligence requirements placed on centralized execution venues will prevent all but the highest quality assets from reaching widespread trading. This by no means precludes investor free choice in decentralized settings. As far as wider token design is concerned, however, it will highlight where the emperor has been shown to have no clothes. Finally, in the sphere of real-world assets (RWAs), crypto investors can look forward to being able to invest in a whole suite of tokenized assets, and not just crypto-native tokens. The provision of tokenized RWAs is primarily a legal question, not a technological one. How are the underpinning assets and rights secured and assured? This subsector of tokens, which requires traditional finance, requires the government. Both are engaging with tokenization in full force. While BlackRock et al. grow out their first tokenized offerings and openly champion the tokenization narrative, governments continue to unveil strategies to embed tokenization in the next generation of financial plumbing. Combined, it offers the investor a diversity of exposure that cannot be achieved in a crypto-only portfolio. Long live the token The combined effect of these dynamics is profound. Where retail direct investment has been blocked, a path to primary public fundraising beckons. Where projects have been disconnected from fundamentals, a structured investment framework emerges. A breadth of tokenized investment types is available, where investment options have been concentrated. The converging future is one of tokenization embedded permanently into capital markets and widespread decentralized applications that flow value directly to a global base of tokenholders. It requires a purge and a reinvention. In the meantime, dont write the token off. Opinion by: Daniel Taylor, head of policy at Zumo.

Apple's Innovation Slows as Valuation Stays Rich|Apples Innovation Slows as Valuation Stays Rich keniofontes Sun, Aug 3, 2025, 4:50 PM 6 min read In This Article: AAPL 0.48 Apple Inc. ( NASDAQ:AAPL ) recently held its WWDC 2025 presentation, and as always, some new developments were expected, which the company did deliver, but they fell far short of expectations or of being factors that would really change the thesis. And that, in my view, sums up Apple today. There is nothing wrong with the company (just as there was nothing exactly bad about the event), it is still quite solid and has huge moats, but in my view, the premium remains unjustifiable, and therefore, the total return, or IRR, is quite low with the current market cap. A Little About Apples WWDC Before talking about WWDC 2025, lets talk about 2024. At the same event last year, the company revealed a number of interesting things for its operating systems. A series of features related to customization, a lot of interesting things for the iPad used with the Apple Pencil, and most importantly, Apple Intelligence. And this Apples AI seemed very promising to boost its product cycle, and the company needed that. So, it was something that took away the burden of Apple being a loser in the AI race and put it back in the forefront, reinforcing the thesis that with its loyal user base and diverse products, it would be able to apply and monetize this well. Well, Apple Intelligence didnt exactly fail; its features are useful, but its worth mentioning that it wasnt quite what it seemed to be a year ago. Some things still need to be improved, and all that. But the point is that, especially when compared to last year, this years event can be labeled as disappointing. The main novelty of WWDC 2025 was Liquid Glass, an interface update that was even a little controversial, with some users concerned about how the interface will be in the next iOS, and some other features that even seem reasonable. But the point here is, there was no super innovative feature, nothing like Apple Intelligence, no eye-catching point related to AI or the like. And that may not seem super worrying, and it really isnt, since its a conference more focused on software and the company will still have the opportunity to surprise us with the launch of the iPhone 17, but still, its as if Apple missed an opportunity to prove itself, and it still needs to do that. Apples Financials Are Just Okay When we analyze the last quarter, revenue was 95.3 billion. This gives us a YoY growth of 5.2, which is already enough for compounding when dealing with a premium company like this. The problem is that in products, growth was less than 3, i.e., what sustained this entire increase was the main bullish pillar of the thesis today: services. Services revenue grew almost 12 YoY. In addition to driving revenue, services are also driving gross margin, which reached 47. This is clearly a very important pillar for Apple, and will most likely be the main generator of value in the coming years. There is nothing wrong with that, except for some uncertainties and dependence. Uncertainties for Apple First, there are uncertainties in services. Even if the company manages to continue adding more services and subscription prices grow at a reasonable pace, there are many regulatory uncertainties. Apple has already faced legal challenges regarding Apple Store fees, for instance. If the company has to lower this fee or open up part of its system for some reason, and this results in lower revenue from its platforms, we may see a slowdown in services growth. The second point is dependence. In my view, the moats are clear, but the valuation is also premium. Therefore, it is not possible to credit the entire value of the thesis to services. There also needs to be clearer triggers for its products, whether the company is implementing new features, innovating in the next iPhones, or creatingexploring new markets, as was the (so far unsuccessful) attempt with Apple Vision Pro. It is worth mentioning that both services and products, even with a loyal fan base and a complete ecosystem that ends up being a barrier to exit, are exposed to the risk of competition. Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (SSNGY), for instance, has been doing a good job with its smartphones in terms of AI integration. India is an emerging market and is one of the triggers for Apple due to premiumization trends in emerging countries as peoples incomes increase and they are able to buy their first smartphones and also migrate to more premium products. But even though this is one of the pillars for enhancing revenue growth, the competition is clear. In the table below, we can see that Apple posted YoY growth of 23 in the Indian market in Q1, but Vivo, Samsung, and other Chinese brands such as Oppo, Realme, and Xiaomi are doing very well too. Apples Innovation Slows as Valuation Stays Rich This raises the bar for Apple and means that its strategies, innovation, and product appeal need to be even greater. As for the gurus, many are reducing their positions in Apple, and not just Warren Buffett ( Trades, Portfolio ). Some examples are Mario Gabelli ( Trades, Portfolio ), Li Lu, Tom Russo ( Trades, Portfolio ), and several others, as this tab shows. Many of these investors are stock pickers, care about value investing, andor have low portfolio turnover, which indicates that Apple is not really compelling enough to make reducing positions an appropriate tactic. The Valuation: Apple Is Almost Worse Than Treasury Bills The 10-Year Treasury yield is currently at 4.5. This means that if we used a discount rate of 4.5 for Apples projected free cash flow, we would be asking for a 0 equity risk premium. To show how the current valuation is not so compelling, lets make optimistic assumptions. For the growth stage, lets assume a 10 CAGR for FCF. For the terminal stage, lets estimate 6. Discounting this at a rate of 5 gives us a fair value of 197, still below Apples current price. Apples Innovation Slows as Valuation Stays Rich It is worth mentioning that this is only a proxy for fair value. It is possible to argue that Apple will not generate free cash flow for only 20 years, and that in good cycles it may present a CAGR above 6. In the last decade, for example, this FCF grew by about 13.7 per share, a result not only of free cash flow growth but also of buybacks. But in my view, this scenario is enough to show that the current price does not offer a high margin of safety. Believing that the indicators will continue to grow at a consistently good pace and discounting at an incredibly low rate (0.5 equity risk premium) is very optimistic, and even then, there would be no upside. The Bottom Line Apple is a premium company and deserves to be recognized for that. Its excellent track record, great profitability figures, strong margins, stable cash flow, and the prospect that it will continue to grow at a healthy pace really need a premium valuation. The question is just how premium it should be. The forward price-to-earnings ratio of 30x shows that for a reasonable upside, the company needs to surprise, and even if this scenario exists, it is not guaranteed. Therefore, at the current price, I am still more cautious about Apple. This article first appeared on GuruFocus. Terms and Privacy Policy Privacy Dashboard More Info
Ripple (XRP) Shows Weakness, Set to Sink as Investor Interest Shifts to New Utility Crypto Predicted to Move from $0.035 to $7|Ripple (XRP) Shows Weakness, Set to Sink as Investor Interest Shifts to New Utility Crypto Predicted to Move from 0.035 to 7 By: Cryptopolitan Media Updated: August 3 2025 10:30 AM As Ripple (XRP) continues to fail to hurdle the key 3 threshold, on-chain data and sentiment within the marketplace reflect a growing fatigue among long-term investors. On the other hand, investor attention is quietly moving to Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a novel utility-focused crypto project thats gaining traction for its utility in decentralized lending markets. On offer for a token price of just 0.035 and predicted to shoot up to 7 by some analysts, Mutuums unique positioning in the DeFi market is responsible for this shift. As XRP grapples with resistance, the spotlight is going quietly to those protocols that are delivering hard use cases, of which Mutuum Finance is emerging as a potential leader among them. XRP Drops Below 3 as Technical Weakness Looms Over It XRP is trading at approximately 2.95 currently, down around 34 over the past day and below the critical 3.00 level following recent resistance that put the July rally to an end. Momentum indicators, including RSI getting stuck in the low 40s and small indecisive candles, indicate the bullish energy is waning, but spikes in open interest and whale accumulation points to profit-taking at recent highs around 3.60. Analysts caution that XRP will not reclaim the base level of 3.00, it would test levels around 2.80 or lower. At the same time, investor interest gradually moves towards DeFi utility tokens such as Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance Presale Growth Mutuum Finance is priced at 0.035 during stage 6 of presale. The token price will rise by 14.29 to 0.04 in phase 7. The ROI for phase 6 buyers amounts to 71.43 since the token enters the market at 0.06. Mutuum Finance has already surpassed the 13.8 million in funding. The project has been capable of onboarding over 14,800 investors so far. New Wave of DeFi Lending Through double models of MUTM lending Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer frameworks users get more freedom and efficiency. Smart contracts are utilized to provide human-less lending within the Peer-to-Contract model. Dynamic interest rates automatically balance the smart contracts to generate high interest rates. Peer-to-Peer architecture excludes middlemen and provides lenders and borrowers with direct access to each other. Enhancing DeFi Security With 50K Bug Bounty and Incentives Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is offering a 100,000 giveaway. There will be 10 winners who will get 10,000 MUTM tokens each. The project has also launched a new top 50 leaderboard of token holders who will be awarded bonus tokens based on their ranks. In order to further strengthen its platform, Mutuum Finance has introduced a Bug Bounty Program for 50,000 in partnership with CertiK. All bugs will be rewarded, and the bounty will be awarded at four tiers, i.e., critical, major, minor, and low. Ripple (XRP) is struggling to hold onto the 3 level, showing signs of losing traction. As investors grow cautious, the majority are shifting focus to Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a new utility cryptocurrency that only costs 0.035. It is currently at Presale Stage 6, with the following stage rising by 14.29 to 0.04. MUTM will be launched at 0.06, with early adopters registering a 71.43 gain from day one. With over 13.8 million raised and 14,800 backers, interest is growing extremely quickly. The project also boasts a 50K CertiK bug bounty, a 100K token giveaway, and practical real-life DeFi applications. Analysts think it could soar to 7, making it one of the most speculative tokens on the market. Get into the presale today before the next price spike shuts this window of opportunity.

Microsoft breaks from 30-year tradition of naming rivals in filings|Synopsis Microsoft has stopped naming its competitors in its annual report, ending a 30-year-long practice. The company is now focusing on broader market trends to describe the competitive landscape. Other tech giants like Amazon and Alphabet have also stopped this practice, while Apple, Meta and Nvidia still follow it. Reuters FILE PHOTO: Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella speaks at the companys annual developer conference in Seattle, Washington, U.S., May 21, 2024. REUTERSMax CherneyFile Photo Tech giant Microsoft has ceased naming its competitors in its annual report in a notable shift away from a common corporate disclosure strategy it had followed for 30 years. The companyâs 2024 annual filing, released earlier this week, does not mention longtime rivals such as Apple and IBM, nor does it cite emerging AI players like Anthropic or Databricks as competitors. In its 2023 annual report, Microsoft listed more than 25 companies as direct competitors. The company has consistently identified its adversaries in public filings since at least 1994. The same goes for other players in the space, like Apple, Facebook parent Meta and Nvidia, who name their rivals in filings. The Windows and CoPilot maker now describes its competitive landscape with references only to categories like productivity software, PC operating systems, and cloud infrastructure. The change was intended to reflect the âfast-moving natureâ of todayâs technology markets, CNBC reported, citing a company spokesperson, with a focus on broader market dynamics rather than individual players. Despite the omission in official filings, Microsoft executives continue to acknowledge competitors in other forums. CEO Satya Nadella referenced Amazon during the companys recent earnings call. Scott Guthrie, executive vice president of Microsoftâs Cloud and AI group, pointedly noted at a May conference that âsome cloud providers, like AWS, still havenât launched a GB200 offering.â The comment referred to Nvidiaâs GB200 NVL72 systems, which integrate 72 high-powered graphics processing units. While Microsoft is stepping back from naming names, itâs not alone in doing so. Amazon hasnât listed competitors in its reports since 1999. Tesla last did so in 2020, and Googleâs parent company, Alphabet, halted the practice after 2022. Microsoft recently reported a strong June quarter, posting a 24 jump in net income at 27.2 billion, primarily driven by growth in AI and cloud technology. The stronger-than-expected earnings and bullish guidance propelled Microsoftâs share, with market capitalisation briefly crossing the 4-trillion mark, making it the second company after Nvidia to achieve the milestone.
Apple CEO Tim Cook tells staff AI is ‘ours to grab’ in hourlong pep talk|Synopsis Tim Cook addressed Apple employees, emphasizing the companys commitment to AI and its potential impact, comparing it to the internet and smartphones. Despite being a late entrant, Apple aims to lead in AI, investing heavily in research and development, including a new cloud-computing chip and AI server facility. Cook also highlighted upcoming product innovations and expansion into emerging markets. Bloomberg Apple Inc. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook, holding a rare all-hands meeting following earnings results, rallied employees around the companyâs artificial intelligence prospects and an âamazingâ pipeline of products. The executive gathered staff at Appleâs on-campus auditorium Friday in Cupertino, California, telling them that the AI revolution is âas big or biggerâ as the internet, smartphones, cloud computing and apps. âApple must do this. Apple will do this. This is sort of ours to grab,â Cook told employees, according to people aware of the meeting. âWe will make the investment to do it.â The iPhone maker has been late to AI, debuting Apple Intelligence months after OpenAI, Alphabet Inc.âs Google, Microsoft Corp. and others flooded the market with products like ChatGPT. And when Apple finally released its AI tools, they fell flat. But Cook struck an optimistic tone, noting that Apple is typically late to promising new technologies. âWeâve rarely been first,â the executive told staffers. âThere was a PC before the Mac; there was a smartphone before the iPhone; there were many tablets before the iPad; there was an MP3 player before iPod.â But Apple invented the âmodernâ versions of those product categories, he said. âThis is how I feel about AI.â An Apple spokesperson declined to comment on the gathering. The hourlong meeting addressed a range of topics, including the retirement of operating chief Jeff Williams, increasing Apple TV viewership and advances in health care with features like the AirPods Pro hearing-aid technology. It also touched on donations and community service by Apple employees, the companyâs goal to become carbon neutral by 2030, and the impact of regulations. âThe reality is that Big Tech is under a lot of scrutiny around the world,â Cook said. âWe need to continue to push on the intention of the regulation and get them to offer that up, instead of these things that destroy the user experience and user privacy and security.â Cook often holds town hall-style chats when visiting Appleâs offices around the world, but companywide meetings from the Steve Jobs Theater at headquarters are unusual. The remarks followed a blockbuster earnings report, with sales growing nearly 10 during the June quarter. That beat Wall Street expectations and eased concerns about iPhone demand and a slowdown in China. Apple still faces myriad challenges, including Trump administration tariffs and a regulatory crackdown on its business practices. The company said Thursday that tariffs would bring a 1.1 billion headwind this quarter, though Apple was upbeat about sales growth. It also said that App Store revenue rose by a percentage in the double digits last quarter, despite efforts in the EU and elsewhere to further restrict that business. Echoing comments he made during the earnings conference call, Cook told employees the company is investing in AI in a âbig way.â He said 12,000 workers were hired in the last year, with 40 of the new hires joining in research and development roles. Appleâs chip development efforts, led by executive Johny Srouji, are key to the companyâs AI strategy, Cook said. Apple is working on a more powerful cloud-computing chip â code-named Baltra â to power artificial intelligence features, Bloomberg News has reported. Itâs also setting up a new AI server manufacturing facility in Houston. The meeting included Craig Federighi, senior vice president of software engineering, who discussed the future of Appleâs Siri voice assistant. The company had planned to roll out a Siri overhaul as part of Apple Intelligence earlier this year, adding the ability to tap into user data to better fulfill requests. It was delayed, spurring management changes for the companyâs AI work. Federighi explained that the problem was caused by trying to roll out a version of Siri that merged two different systems: one for handling current commands â like setting timers â and another based on large language models, the software behind generative AI. âWe initially wanted to do a hybrid architecture, but we realized that approach wasnât going to get us to Apple quality,â Federighi said. Now, Apple is working on a version of Siri that moves to an entirely new architecture for all of its capabilities. That iteration is slated for as early as spring, Bloomberg News has reported, though Apple executives havenât confirmed a timeline other than a release next year. âThe work weâve done on this end-to-end revamp of Siri has given us the results we needed,â the engineering executive told employees. âThis has put us in a position to not just deliver what we announced, but to deliver a much bigger upgrade than we envisioned. There is no project people are taking more seriously.â Federighi cited leadership changes, including putting Vision Pro creator Mike Rockwell and his headset software leadership team in charge of Siri, as a driving force in improving the product. He said Rockwell and his group have âsuperchargedâ the companyâs work in the area. In his speech, Cook also pushed employees to move more quickly to weave AI into their work and future products. âAll of us are using AI in a significant way already, and we must use it as a company as well,â Cook said. âTo not do so would be to be left behind, and we canât do that.â Employees should push to deploy AI tools faster, and urge their managers and service and support teams to do the same, he said. Cook also addressed the companyâs retail strategy, stressing that the current plan is to focus on opening new stores in emerging markets and upping the investment in Appleâs online store. The iPhone maker is opening outlets in India, the United Arab Emirates and China this year, and is preparing to add its first location in Saudi Arabia next year. âWe need to be in more countries, and youâll see us go into more emerging markets in particular,â Cook said. That doesnât mean Apple will ignore other places, he said, but a âdisproportionate amount of growthâ will be in new areas. The CEO also shared his enthusiasm about upcoming products, though he didnât get specific. âI have never felt so much excitement and so much energy before as right now,â he said. Bloomberg News has previously reported that Apple plans to launch its first foldable iPhone next year and is also working on a stream of smart home devices. New headset products, smart glasses, a push into robotics and a redesigned iPhone for the two-decade anniversary are also underway. âThe product pipeline, which I canât talk about: Itâs amazing, guys. Itâs amazing,â Cook said. âSome of it youâll see soon, some of it will come later, but thereâs a lot to see.â
From global agreements to local action: India’s opportunity to lead the way in VDA governance|TIL Creatives The Virtual Digital Asset ( VDA ) ecosystem is one of the most exciting and rapidly growing sectors globally. What began with the publication of the Bitcoin whitepaper in 2008 has, in under two decades, evolved into a diverse and expansive global industry. Today, Bitcoin is just one component of a much broader landscape that includes tokens, smart contracts, decentralised finance, and blockchain infrastructure. India has emerged as a global leader in this ecosystem. It has consistently ranked first on the Chainalysis Global Crypto Adoption Index and is home to one of the worlds largest Web3 developer communities, as highlighted in the Electric Capital Developer Report 2024. This sustained momentum presents a timely and strategic opportunity for India to engage with a technology that is rapidly moving from the margins to the mainstream of the digital economy.

Since then, most G20 jurisdictions have made significant progress. Did you Know? The world of cryptocurrencies is very dynamic. Prices can go up or down in a matter of seconds. Thus, having reliable answers to such questions is crucial for investors. View Details The European Unions landmark MiCA framework came into full force in December 2024, setting a global precedent. In the U.S., regulatory momentum has picked up, with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) forming a dedicated Crypto Task Force, and a presidential executive order on the Bitcoin Reserve and the U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile pushing the agenda toward concrete legislative action. Live Events Most recently, on June 17, the U.S. Senate passed the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act. These developments highlight the critical role legislatures play in shaping emerging tech policy and demonstrate how both legislative and executive branches must work together to sustain regulatory momentum. In India, however, a formal discourse on regulating VDAs remains absent. The current framework is limited to AMLCFT oversight, a steep taxation regime, and a proposal to collect and exchange data on VDA transactions via the CARF (Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework). One of the glaring gaps in Indias governance architecture is Parliament s limited engagement with emerging technologies, particularly VDAs and blockchain innovations. It is noteworthy that between 2021 and 2025, of the 52,116 questions asked in the Lok Sabha, only 0.063 were related to cryptoassets, cryptocurrency, or VDAs. In the Rajya Sabha, this figure stands at 0.08 of the 32,398 questions from 20212024. As for debates, the 17th Lok Sabha saw only three discussionstwo through Zero Hour speeches and one Special Mention. The ongoing 18th session has seen none so far. In 2021, Parliament did indicate its intent to develop a legislative framework on cryptoassets, but that effort did not move forward. Interestingly, India announced plans to release a Discussion Paper (DP) on VDAs in July 2024. The DP is a crucial first step; however, nearly a year has passed since the announcement, and the paper is still awaited. Its timely release, coupled with engagement from a proactive and informed Parliament, will be key to advancing this vision. With only a handful of MPs currently equipped to navigate the nuances of digital innovation, there is a pressing need to build institutional capacity for informed legislative engagement. The Honourable Lok Sabha Speaker recently underscored the urgency of these issues, highlighting the importance of appropriate regulatory systems, data privacy protection, and equitable tech access being discussed across national parliaments. The complexity of VDAsspanning taxation, financial markets, security, privacy, and global compliancerequires robust and sustained parliamentary dialogue. Sustaining this momentum will require improving MP awareness through briefing sessions, committee consultations, and cross-party engagement. Indias ambitious Viksit Bharat vision for 2047 hinges on inclusive growth and leadership in not only digital public infrastructure but also sunrise sectors such as AI, digital technology, andcriticallyfintech. As VDAs become an integral part of this landscape, the forthcoming Discussion Paper presents a timely opportunity to chart a clear, forward-looking regulatory path. But turning this opportunity into action will require more than just policy intent; it demands a proactive, informed, and engaged Parliament. A strong legislative foundationgrounded in debate and cross-party collaborationwill be essential for India to not only keep pace with global developments but also lead in shaping the future of digital finance and technology governance.

'US 2.0, India 6.4': Piyush Goyal takes a dig at Donald Trump, says ‘India’s economy is THRIVING’|ANI Piyush Goyal Union Minister Piyush Goyal today shared the latest International Monetary Fund (IMF) growth projections on social media, highlighting Indias strong economic outlook amid US President Donald Trumps controversial remarks calling India and Russia dead economies. Without taking any name, Goyal posted a chart from the IMFs World Economic Outlook Update (July 2025) and wrote: Indias economy is THRIVING. The chart shows India leading global growth through 2026, with a projected GDP growth rate of 6.4, compared to the United States 2.0. India tops growth forecast, US lags behind According to IMF estimates, India is expected to grow at 6.5 in 2024, and sustain 6.4 growth in both 2025 and 2026. In contrast, the US economy is projected to grow at 2.8 in 2024, falling to 1.9 in 2025 and rising slightly to 2.0 in 2026. Indias performance also outpaces other major economies such as Germany (0.2 in 2024), Japan (0.2), and the UK (1.1).

Advanced economies are expected to lag behind, with the Euro Area growing at 0.9 in 2024 and Japan at just 0.2. Among emerging markets, India leads the table, followed by China at 5.0 in 2024 and 4.2 in 2026. Goyals remarks in Parliament Earlier during the ongoing Monsoon Session of Parliament, Goyal responded to Trumps comments by highlighting Indias economic rise over the last decade. Within just a decade, India has transformed from being one of the Fragile Five economies to one of the largest economies in the world, he said. We have become one of the top five economies in the world due to our reforms and the hard work of our farmers, entrepreneurs and MSMEs. Soon, we will become the third-largest economy in the world.

They can take their dead economies down together, for all I care. We have done very little business with India, their Tariffs are too high, among the highest in the World. India will therefore be paying a tariff of 25 per cent, plus a penalty for the above, starting on August first. Trump further criticised Indias trade regime, calling it the most strenuous and obnoxious non-monetary trade barriers of any country. India faces tariff and penalty for Russian imports Last week, Trump announced a 25 tariff on all Indian goods starting August 1, alongside an additional penalty for Indias crude oil and military purchases from Russia. The announcement followed reports that a US trade delegation would visit New Delhi later this month to explore a bilateral trade deal. India is currently the second-largest buyer of Russian crude after China. Its share of oil imports from Russia has risen from under 1 before the Ukraine war to nearly 40 now. (You can now

Will Macy's (M) Beat Estimates Again in Its Next Earnings Report?|Will Macys (M) Beat Estimates Again in Its Next Earnings Report? Zacks Equity Research Fri, Aug 1, 2025, 9:40 PM 3 min read In This Article: M -3.72 If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report, you should consider Macys (M). This company, which is in the Zacks Retail - Regional Department Stores industry, shows potential for another earnings beat. This department store operator has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 15.21. For the most recent quarter, Macys was expected to post earnings of 0.16 per share, but it reported 0.14 per share instead, representing a surprise of 14.29. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was 1.55 per share, while it actually produced 1.8 per share, a surprise of 16.13. Price and EPS Surprise For Macys, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stocks positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), its a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank. Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank 3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70 of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven. The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier. Macys currently has an Earnings ESP of 8.70, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the companys earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stocks Zacks Rank 3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. When the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stocks earnings miss. Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate. Because of this, its really important to check a companys Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before theyve reported. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Rail deal will open new markets for top US container port|Rail deal will open new markets for top US container port A Union Pacific intermodal train is shown in the Alameda Corridor. (Photo: Alameda Corridor Transportation Authority) Stuart Chirls Thu, Jul 31, 2025, 11:40 PM 3 min read In This Article: NSC 1.19 UNP 1.21 M -3.72 The Port of Los Angeles stands poised for significant growth and transformational change following news of Union Pacifics plans to acquire Norfolk Southern (NYSE: NSC ) and create the nations first transcontinental freight railroad. In a phone interview with FreightWaves, Executive Director Gene Seroka emphasized the vast opportunities presented by the historic rail agreement, particularly in terms of enhancing cargo flow and expanding reach into key markets across the country. Weve been working real closely with Union Pacific (NYSE: UNP ) on bringing more cargo in to go through the Alameda Corridor, Seroka said, referring to the below-grade rail freight route used by UP and BNSF to access the San Pedro port complex, which he said was a great investment but underutilized. The 85 billion rail consolidation aims to optimize the use of the corridor, opening up access to the populous regions east of the Mississippi, and boosting intermodal freight capabilities out of the southern California container hub. Seroka reminisced about past successes in transcontinental cargo movement as president of the Americas for American President Lines, noting how apparel was efficiently transported from Asia to New York. Think about garments on hangars that would come right out of the box to Macys on 34th Street in Manhattans Garment District and get put right on their racks, he recalled. This efficient supply chain model is a compelling vision for future operations, especially with the potential enhanced efficiency from the merger. Seroka said that the rail-tie up would enable more efficient transportation of goods from Los Angeles to East Coast destinations. Youre reducing paperwork and handoffs, youre improving digital technology and youre sailing on a ship getting to Los Angeles to on- dock rail through the Alameda Corridor, he said. Theres the retail consuming area of the tri-state New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, the ability to get to Boston, to get to the Mid- And South Atlantic, to get to the Sunbelt, which is growing so fast. And you can do that today, but if you combine the two companies, whether its steel wheel interchange at UPs Global 4 terminal north of Chicago or west of Cleveland, you now have the same company trying to make that turn more efficient. The prospect of streamlined logistics would benefit other major markets. That will also buoy our biggest markets like Chicago where 20 of our intermodal goes, and then to Memphis and Dallas, but also to get to secondary and tertiary markets quicker. Think of Kansas City, Denver, Salt Lake City. Theres going to probably be a reconfiguration of how the two companies combined to get deeper and longer into this market. Despite the transformative potential, the merger is subject to multi-level approvals. Seroka expressed confidence in the diligent work being conducted at both the federal and state levels to secure this future. Were confident both companies have been working on that, he said. But what the merger does is it improves our service offering. You know whats interesting? When just before the Alameda Corridor opened in 2002, 41 of our imports were intermodal. It dropped down as low as 23. These ports on the East and Gulf coasts for decades now have hired switched-on leaders, aligned with policymakers and have made massive investment. Cargo owners have gone to a four-corner strategy of port diversification. Its now possible to get to Chicago from a Mid-Atlantic port. But this puts us back in the game with a higher level of service offering to go out and champion the cause for that discretionary cargo.
How to Find Strong Retail-Wholesale Stocks Slated for Positive Earnings Surprises|How to Find Strong Retail-Wholesale Stocks Slated for Positive Earnings Surprises Zacks Equity Research Thu, Jul 31, 2025, 6:30 PM 2 min read In This Article: BURL 2.79 M -3.72 Wall Street watches a companys quarterly report closely to understand as much as possible about its recent performance and what to expect going forward. Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings. We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises. 2 Stocks to Add to Your Watchlist The Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a companys report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure. Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, lets dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Macys (M) earns a Zacks Rank 3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at 0.20 a share, just 20 days from its upcoming earnings release on August 20, 2025. Macys Earnings ESP sits at 8.7, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the 0.20 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 0.18. M is one of just a large database of Retail-Wholesale stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is Burlington Stores (BURL). Slated to report earnings on September 4, 2025, Burlington Stores holds a 3 (Hold) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and its Most Accurate Estimate is 1.36 a share 35 days from its next quarterly update. For Burlington Stores, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of 1.25 is 8.55. M and BURLs positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.

What makes a meme stock? Online enthusiasm for a beaten down company with doubtful prospects|What makes a meme stock? Online enthusiasm for a beaten down company with doubtful prospects DAMIAN TROISE Wed, Jul 30, 2025, 10:00 PM 3 min read In This Article: GME DNUT KSS M WMT NEW YORK (AP) Investors occasionally scoop up shares of companies whose financial prospects appear dim. The consensus around such companies is that the shares should, if anything, fall further. But they suddenly get touted in online forums and take off for no fundamental reason. Wall Street has dubbed them meme stocks. Here are some characteristics of meme stocks: Poor growth prospects Meme stock investors typically look for companies with poor financials that are unlikely to grow much in coming years. This could be due to a number of factors, such as an outdated business model or fierce competition. Examples: GameStop, the original meme stock, faced a changing gaming environment where online gaming essentially replaced the need for video-game rental stores. Kohls, battered for years by growth of online shopping, is now facing an increasingly competitive retail market that includes traditional department stores like Macys and big-box retailers like Walmart. Beaten down share price Meme stocks are cheap. Thats often part of the big attraction for investors looking to turn a quick profit. The low price allows for easier entry. Examples: Krispy Kreme, known for its light and airy doughnuts, landed on Wall Street in 2021 at more than 19 per share. It sank below 3 last month. AMC Entertainment is a more extreme example. It was an 11 stock before the 2021 meme stock craze pushed it above 300. Its now trading at about 3 per share. Big bets on the price dropping further Big interest from short sellers often precedes a beaten down stocks transformation into a meme. Short sellers are essentially betting against the stock in an effort to turn a profit. They do this by borrowing shares from a broker, then selling those shares. When the price drops, they buy back the shares at the lower price, give the shares back to the broker and pocket the profit. Part of a meme stocks identity involves investors suddenly buying highly shorted stocks, which drives the price up. That forces short sellers to also start buying the stock to cover their losses, which is called a short squeeze. That drives the stock price even higher and results in a meme stock rally that benefits the investors who bought shares at their low point. Hype Online buzz is usually the key source powering a meme stock and not any change in the companys fundamentals. The hype typically comes from forums and platforms such as Reddit or YouTube. Example: GameStops entry to meme status started from a keyboard. Investor Keith Gill, better known as Roaring Kitty, rallied other investors to join him in buying up thousands of GameStop shares, changing the trajectory of the stock. Volatility Investing in meme stocks takes nerve. Gains can evaporate as quickly as they came. Example: Opendoor Technologies. The beaten down online real estate companys stock was trading below 1 per share through early July, then surged to as much 3.21 in the middle of the month as hedge fund manager Eric Jackson touted the stock on X. The stock is still trading just above 2, but that means buyers at the height of its rally ultimately suffered a loss. Terms and Privacy Policy Privacy Dashboard More Info
O-I GLASS REPORTS SECOND QUARTER 2025 RESULTS|This is a paid press release. Contact the press release distributor directly with any inquiries. O-I GLASS REPORTS SECOND QUARTER 2025 RESULTS Owens-Illinois General Inc. Wed, Jul 30, 2025, 1:50 AM 14 min read In This Article: OI 0.86 M -3.72 Owens-Illinois General Inc. PERRYSBURG, Ohio, July 29, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Strong Second Quarter Performance As Fit to Win Momentum Accelerates Increasing Full-Year 2025 Guidance O-I Glass, Inc. (O-I) (NYSE: OI) today reported financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2025. Net Earnings (Loss) Attributable to the Company Per Share (Diluted) Earnings Before Income Taxes M 2Q25 2Q24 2Q25 2Q24 Reported (0.03 ) 0.36 7 104 Adjusted Earnings Earnings Per Share (Diluted) Segment Operating Profit M 2Q25 2Q24 2Q25 2Q24 Non GAAP 0.53 0.44 225 233 Our teams executed effectively to deliver a strong second quarter 2025 performance, despite a sluggish demand environment, said Gordon Hardie, Chief Executive Officer of O-I Glass. While reported earnings declined year-over-year due to restructuring charges, our adjusted earnings rose 20 percent compared to the second quarter of last year. Notably, the companys continued performance on Fit to Win initiatives to improve our competitive position has more than offset macroeconomic softness in several markets. The company remains focused on executing against controllable factorsand the results reflect that discipline. Year-to-date, Fit to Win benefits have reached 145 million, reinforcing our confidence in achieving or surpassing the ambitious goals we set during our recent Investor Day. Given our strong performance and momentum, we are raising our full-year 2025 guidance and now anticipate adjusted earnings will increase 60 to 90 percent over 2024. Following a comprehensive review, we have made the financially prudent decision to halt further MAGMA development and operations. While the earlier stages delivered meaningful technical advancements, we have concluded the platform does not have a pathway to the operational or financial return requirements as previously outlined. Through our Best at Both operations strategy, as outlined at Investor Day, we believe we can drive significantly higher premium output at lower operating cost and capital intensity than MAGMA would have realized in the coming years. This decision aligns with our focus on driving competitiveness and economic profit. Accordingly, we intend to reconfigure our Bowling Green facility into a best-cost, premium-focused operation. We are confident this is the right path forward for our business, our customers, and our shareholders, Hardie concluded. Second Quarter 2025 Results O-I Glass reported second quarter 2025 net sales of 1.7 billion, consistent with the prior year. Net Sales benefited from favorable currency translation; however, this was offset by slightly lower selling prices and an approximately 3 percent decline in shipment volume (in tons). While demand increased in the Americas, it softened in Europe. On a year-to-date basis, shipment volumes were up nearly 1 percent compared to the prior year. Earnings before income taxes totaled 7 million, down from 104 million in the same period last year. This decline primarily reflected items not considered representative of ongoing operations, including 108 million in restructuring and asset impairment charges, largely associated with the discontinuation of the MAGMA program. Additionally, segment operating profit was modestly lower, though this was partially offset by improved retained corporate and other costs. Segment operating profit was 225 million in the second quarter compared to 233 million in the same period of 2024. Americas : Segment operating profit rose to 135 million, up from 106 million in the prior year period. This increase was driven by significant operating cost reductions from our Fit to Win initiatives and a 4 percent growth in sales volume as a result of improved competitiveness. These gains were partially offset by unfavorable currency translation and by slightly lower net price. Europe : Segment operating profit declined to 90 million, down from 127 million in the prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to unfavorable net price, an approximately 9 percent drop in sales volume (in tons), and higher operating costs due to increased temporary production curtailments aimed at reducing inventory. These headwinds were partially mitigated by Fit to Win savings and favorable currency translation. Retained corporate and other costs improved to 25 million, down from 32 million in the prior year period, reflecting Fit to Win benefits partially offset by other costs including higher management incentives. Net interest expense was 85 million, slightly lower than 87 million in the second quarter of 2024. The company reported a net loss attributable to the company of 0.03 per share in the second quarter of 2025, down from net earnings of 0.36 per share (diluted) in the prior year period mostly due to items not considered representative of ongoing operations. Adjusted earnings were 0.53 per share (diluted) up from 0.44 per share (diluted) in the second quarter of 2024. Updated Full-Year 2025 Outlook 2025 Guidance 2024 Current Previous Actual Adjusted Earnings Per Share (EPS) 1.30 - 1.55 1.20 - 1.50 0.81 Free Cash Flow Source (Use) (M) 150 - 200 150 - 200 ( 128 ) O-I continues to expect full-year 2025 sales volumes will be in line with prior year levels. Reflecting strong year-to-date performance and continued momentum from the Fit to Win program, the company has raised its full-year 2025 adjusted earnings guidance to a range of 1.30 to 1.55 per share, up from the previous outlook of 1.20 to 1.50 per share. This represents a projected improvement of 60 to 90 percent over 2024 results. The company continues to anticipate free cash flow of 150 to 200 million for the full year which is about a 300 million improvement from the prior year, despite 140 to 150 million in cash restructuring costs. In late July 2025, and in addition to halting MAGMA, the company finalized its plans for the indefinite suspension of operations of one furnace as well as the closure of one plant in its Americas segment. These actions are part of O-Is Fit to Win initiative to reduce redundant capacity and begin to optimize its network. Subject to finalization of certain estimates, the company expects to record charges associated with these closures of approximately 45 million in the third quarter of 2025. Guidance primarily reflects the companys current view on sales and production volume, mix and working capital trends; it may not fully reflect the potential impact of tariffs on U.S. imports or retaliatory tariffs on U.S. exports. O-Is adjusted earnings outlook assumes foreign currency rates as of July 28, 2025, and a full-year adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 33 to 36 percent. The earnings and cash flow guidance ranges may not fully reflect uncertainty in macroeconomic conditions, currency rates, energy and raw materials costs, supply chain disruptions, labor challenges, and success in global profitability improvement initiatives, among other factors. Conference Call Scheduled for July 30, 2025 O-Is management team will conduct a conference call to discuss the companys latest results on Wednesday, July 30, 2025, at 8:00 a.m. EDT A live webcast of the conference call, including presentation materials, will be available on the O-I website, www.o-i.cominvestors, in the News and Events section.

Learn more about us: o-i.com Facebook Twitter Instagram LinkedIn Non-GAAP Financial Measures The company uses certain non-GAAP financial measures, which are measures of its historical or future financial performance that are not calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, within the meaning of applicable SEC rules. Management believes that its presentation and use of certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings, adjusted earnings per share, free cash flow, segment operating profit, segment operating profit margin and adjusted effective tax rate provide relevant and useful supplemental financial information that is widely used by analysts and investors, as well as by management in assessing both consolidated and business unit performance. These non-GAAP measures are reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and should be considered supplemental in nature and should not be considered in isolation or be construed as being more important than comparable GAAP measures. Adjusted earnings relates to net earnings (loss) attributable to the company, exclusive of items management considers not representative of ongoing operations and other adjustments because such items are not reflective of the companys principal business activity, which is glass container production. Adjusted earnings are divided by weighted average shares outstanding (diluted) to derive adjusted earnings per share. Segment operating profit relates to earnings before interest expense, net, and before income taxes and is also exclusive of items management considers not representative of ongoing operations as well as certain retained corporate costs and other adjustments. Segment operating profit margin is calculated as segment operating profit divided by segment net sales. Adjusted effective tax rate relates to provision for income taxes, exclusive of items management considers not representative of ongoing operations and other adjustments divided by earnings before income taxes, exclusive of items management considers not representative of ongoing operations and other adjustments. Management uses adjusted earnings, adjusted earnings per share, segment operating profit, segment operating profit margin and adjusted effective tax rate to evaluate its period-over-period operating performance because it believes these provide useful supplemental measures of the results of operations of its principal business activity by excluding items that are not reflective of such operations. The above non-GAAP financial measures may be useful to investors in evaluating the underlying operating performance of the companys business as these measures eliminate items that are not reflective of its principal business activity. Further, free cash flow relates to cash provided by operating activities less cash payments for property, plant, and equipment. Management has historically used free cash flow to evaluate its period-over-period cash generation performance because it believes these have provided useful supplemental measures related to its principal business activity. It should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures, since the company has mandatory debt service requirements and other non-discretionary expenditures that are not deducted from these measures. Management uses non-GAAP information principally for internal reporting, forecasting, budgeting and calculating compensation payments. The company routinely posts important information on its website www.o-i.cominvestors. Forward-Looking Statements This press release contains forward-looking statements related to O-I Glass, Inc.

Dillard's, Macy's, Arhaus, Petco, and Warby Parker Shares Are Falling, What You Need To Know|Dillards, Macys, Arhaus, Petco, and Warby Parker Shares Are Falling, What You Need To Know Dillards, Macys, Arhaus, Petco, and Warby Parker Shares Are Falling, What You Need To Know Kayode Omotosho Wed, Jul 30, 2025, 12:45 AM 3 min read In This Article: DDS -0.03 M -3.72 ARHS 3.92 WRBY 3.77 What Happened? A number of stocks fell in the afternoon session after reports pointed to a broad-based weakening of consumer health, highlighted by rising loan delinquencies and falling spending intentions. This downturn was fueled by multiple reports signaling a deteriorating financial situation for consumers. Data revealed that even upper-income Americans are increasingly falling behind on credit card and auto loan payments, suggesting big-ticket spending is fading. Further dampening sentiment, the latest Consumer Confidence report, despite a headline increase, showed that consumers are being more cautious. The auto sector also flashed warning signs, with projections for July showing flat sales compared to last year, weighed down by high prices and interest rates. The stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Among others, the following stocks were impacted: Department Store company Dillards (NYSE:DDS) fell 5.5. Is now the time to buy Dillards? Access our full analysis report here, its free.

Access our full analysis report here, its free. Zooming In On Dillards (DDS) Dillards shares are quite volatile and have had 18 moves greater than 5 over the last year. In that context, todays move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business. The previous big move we wrote about was 1 day ago when the stock gained 3 on the news that JPMorgan Chase Co. raised its price target on the retailer. Investment analysts at the firm increased their price objective to 458.00 from 368.00, citing a strong end to the quarter that was driven by a rise in consumer activity in July. Despite the upgraded price target, JPMorgan maintained its underweight rating, which signaled a continued cautious outlook on the stocks performance relative to the market. The market reacted positively to the price target change, and the shares reached a new all-time high of 511.02 during the session. Dillards is up 8.1 since the beginning of the year, and at 487.43 per share, it is trading close to its 52-week high of 513.16 from July 2025. Investors who bought 1,000 worth of Dillards shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth 19,544. Todays young investors likely havent read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next. 條款 及 私隱政策 Privacy Dashboard More Info

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES (Millions of dollars except per share data) (Unaudited) We supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) with certain non-GAAP financial measures, some of which we refer to as ongoing measures. These measures may include earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), EBIT margin, ongoing EBIT, ongoing EBIT margin, ongoing earnings per diluted share, adjusted effective tax rate, net debt leverage (Net DebtOngoing EBITDA), return on invested capital (ROIC) and free cash flow. Ongoing measures exclude items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, results from our ongoing operations and provide a better baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses. Sales excluding foreign currency: Current period net sales translated in functional currency, to U.S. dollars using the applicable prior periods exchange rate compared to the applicable prior period net sales. Management believes that sales excluding foreign currency provides stockholders with a clearer basis to assess our results over time, excluding the impact of exchange rate fluctuations. Ongoing EBIT margin: Ongoing earnings before interest and taxes divided by net sales. Ongoing measures exclude items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, results from our ongoing operations and provide a better baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses. Ongoing earnings per diluted share: Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations, adjusted to exclude items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, results from our ongoing operations. Ongoing measures provide a better baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses. Net debt leverage: Net debt to ongoing earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) ratio is net debt outstanding, including long-term debt, current maturities of long-term debt, and notes payable, less cash and cash equivalents, divided by ongoing EBITDA. Management believes that net debt leverage provides stockholders with a view of our ability to generate earnings sufficient to service our debt. Return on invested capital: Ongoing EBIT after taxes divided by total invested capital, defined as total assets less non-interest bearing current liabilities (NIBCLS). NIBCLS is defined as current liabilities less current maturities of long-term debt and notes payable. This ROIC definition may differ from other companies methods and therefore may not be comparable to those used by other companies. Management believes that ROIC provides stockholders with a view of capital efficiency, a key driver of stockholder value creation. Adjusted effective tax rate: Effective tax rate, excluding pre-tax income and tax effect of certain unique items. Management believes that adjusted tax rate provides stockholders with a meaningful, consistent comparison of the Companys effective tax rate, excluding the pre-tax income and tax effect of certain unique items. Free cash flow: Cash provided by (used in) operating activities less capital expenditures. Management believes that free cash flow provides stockholders with a relevant measure of liquidity and a useful basis for assessing the Companys ability to fund its activities and obligations. Whirlpool does not provide a non-GAAP reconciliation for its forward-looking long-term value creation goals, such as EBIT, free cash flow conversion, ROIC and net debt leverage, as these long-term management goals are not annual guidance, and the reconciliation of these long-term measures would rely on market factors and certain other conditions and assumptions that are outside of the Companys control. We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide meaningful information to assist investors and stockholders in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance, and reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that, when viewed with our GAAP financial measures, provide a more complete understanding of our business. Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. These ongoing financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for reported net earnings available to Whirlpool per diluted share, net earnings, net earnings available to Whirlpool, net earnings margin, return on assets, net sales, effective tax rate and cash provided by (used in) operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. We also disclose segment EBIT as an important financial metric used by the Companys Chief Operating Decision Maker to evaluate performance and allocate resources in accordance with ASC 280 - Segment Reporting. GAAP net earnings available to Whirlpool per basic or diluted share (as applicable) and ongoing earnings per diluted share are presented net of tax, while individual adjustments in each reconciliation are presented on a pre-tax basis; the income tax impact line item aggregates the tax impact for these adjustments. The tax impact of individual line item adjustments may not foot precisely to the aggregate income tax impact amount, as each line item adjustment may include non-taxable components. Historical quarterly earnings per share amounts are presented based on a normalized tax rate adjustment to reconcile quarterly tax rates to full-year tax rate expectations. We strongly encourage investors and stockholders to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. SECOND-QUARTER 2025 ONGOING EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST AND TAXES AND ONGOING EARNINGS PER DILUTED SHARE The reconciliation provided below reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures ongoing earnings before interest and taxes and ongoing earnings per diluted share, with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, net earnings (loss) available to Whirlpool and net earnings (loss) per diluted share available to Whirlpool, for the three months ended June 30, 2025.

FULL-YEAR 2025 OUTLOOK FOR ONGOING EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST AND TAXES AND ONGOING EARNINGS PER DILUTED SHARE The reconciliation provided below reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures ongoing earnings before interest and taxes and ongoing earnings per diluted share, with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, net earnings available to Whirlpool and net earnings per diluted share available to Whirlpool, for the twelve months ending December 31, 2025.

Earnings Before Interest Taxes (EBIT) is a non-GAAP measure. The Company does not provide a forward-looking quantitative reconciliation of EBIT to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, net earnings available to Whirlpool, because the net earnings available to noncontrolling interests item of such reconciliation -- which has historically represented a relatively insignificant amount of the Companys overall net earnings -- implicates the Companys projections regarding the earnings of the Companys non wholly-owned subsidiaries and joint ventures that cannot be quantified precisely or without unreasonable efforts. FOOTNOTES a. RESTRUCTURING EXPENSE - We incurred restructuring charges of 2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2025 compared to 50 million for the same period in 2024. b.

Ongoing earnings per share was calculated using an adjusted tax rate of 22.5, which excludes the tax impacts related to MA transaction costs and restructuring actions. During the second quarter of 2024, the Company calculated a GAAP tax rate of (687). Ongoing earnings per share was calculated using an adjusted tax rate of (14), which excludes the non-tax deductible impact of MA transactions of approximately 50 million recorded in the second quarter of 2024.

Why Macy's (M) Stock Is Up Today|Why Macys (M) Stock Is Up Today Why Macys (M) Stock Is Up Today Anthony Lee Mon, Jul 28, 2025, 9:30 PM 2 min read In This Article: M -3.72 What Happened? Shares of department store chain Macys (NYSE:M) jumped 4.3 in the morning session after the company announced positive early results for its cash tender offer and upsized the deal. The retailers subsidiary, Macys Retail Holdings, LLC, increased the maximum combined aggregate purchase price for its outstanding notes and debentures to 250 million. A debt tender offer is a process where a company offers to repurchase some of its outstanding debt from investors before it matures. This action was often viewed positively by investors as a sign of financial strength and confidence in future cash flows. By reducing its debt, the company worked to lower its future interest payments and strengthen its balance sheet, which likely contributed to the positive investor sentiment. After the initial pop the shares cooled down to 13.55, up 3.6 from previous close. Is now the time to buy Macys? Access our full analysis report here, its free. What Is The Market Telling Us Macys shares are very volatile and have had 21 moves greater than 5 over the last year. In that context, todays move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business. The biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 11 months ago when the stock dropped 14 on the news that the company reported weak second quarter earnings. Its full-year revenue and earnings guidance were lowered, missing Wall Streets estimates. Management noted that the new guidance reflects a more discriminating consumer and heightened promotional environment relative to its prior expectations. On the other hand, revenue came in roughly in line with expectations during the quarter, while EPS beat by a more convincing margin. Overall, this was a weaker quarter due to the outlook. Macys is down 18.2 since the beginning of the year, and at 13.55 per share, it is trading 25.2 below its 52-week high of 18.10 from December 2024. Investors who bought 1,000 worth of Macys shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth 2,107. Here at StockStory, we certainly understand the potential of thematic investing. Diverse winners from Microsoft (MSFT) to Alphabet (GOOG), Coca-Cola (KO) to Monster Beverage (MNST) could all have been identified as promising growth stories with a megatrend driving the growth. So, in that spirit, weve identified a relatively under-the-radar profitable growth stock benefiting from the rise of AI, available to you FREE via this link.

Courtesy of Abercrombie Fitch Co. This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback. Dive Brief: In another sign that brands once again appreciate wholesale and department stores Macys is now selling an assortment from Abercrombie Kids as part of its back-to-school merchandising. The collection of jeans, T-shirts, dresses, skirts, sweaters, outerwear and accessories, in sizes 5 to 18, is available in stores and online, according to a Monday press release. Also for back to school and dorm life, the department store is touting items from Nike, Adidas, Levis, Juniors, Arch Studio, Charter Club, Sun and Stone and Mode of One. Dive Insight: This tie-up of Macys with Abercrombie Kids is a smart move for both retailers, according to Liza Amlani, co-author of The Whole Sale Profitable Wholesale Strategies for Brands. The move aligns with Abercrombie Fitch Co.s effort to expand distribution of its childrens brand, announced last year, a company spokesperson said by email. That includes a deal to expand internationally. It also benefits both when it comes to the disruption caused by tariffs, Amlani said. Abercrombie Fitch is working with their suppliers to optimize their supply chain and product costs in response to the tariff chaos, Amlani said by phone. Macys will work with the brand to get a landed wholesale cost they can work with and everyone wins. Macys also gains from the brands strong track record of merchandising localized assortments. Abercrombie is already stocking its stores with back-to-school product and has already done the work in terms of building the right assortment for their different regions, Amlani said. Macys can tap into these insights and assort their product mix according to AFs insights. Specialty retail sliding into department stores isnt new Gap apparel can be found in department stores abroad and Macys in the U.S., she noted. But department stores have regained attention from legacy brands like Abercrombie and Nike as well as newer entrants that started out as online pure-plays, according to Amlani. What I am seeing is the growth in wholesale strategies for brands that are looking to grow and scale with new markets, she said. purchase licensing rights Filed Under: Marketing, Department Stores

The uproar over Vogue’s AI-generated ad isn’t just about fashion|AI The uproar over Vogues AI-generated ad isnt just about fashion Its just so much cheaper. Brands need a lot of content. Rebecca Bellan Dominic-Madori Davis 6:00 AM PDT August 3, 2025
The founder working to build AI’s real-time backbone and solve the data bottleneck|Artificial intelligence has rapidly become a central part of business planning across a wide-variety of industries, including finance, healthcare, logistics, and national infrastructure. But as the sophistication of AI models continues to improve, one glaring issue remains: the single point of failure for this technology isnt the model, but the data it relies on. Data preparation, data debugging, and data quality monitoring are widely considered to be the three primary sources of bottlenecks with data, which results in AI evolving faster than the data systems and controls used to feed models. Daniel Kornum, better known as DK, founded NakedSignal to solve this problem by bringing the data speed and precision of high-frequency trading into broader AI. With the global data market projected to grow to over 5 trillion, Kornum sees data as the true enabler of the next AI wave, not just models. Heres a closer look at the life and career of a systems thinker operating at the intersection of finance, data, and emerging infrastructure. The founder: a systems thinker with excellent experience in execution DKs fascination with systems optimization began at a young age, when he would code bots for online games while still at school. He managed to get into Cambridge University, where he studied both economics and mathematics, ultimately receiving top marks in corporate finance for his BA and MA. While there, he became a member of the Hawks Club, Cambridges oldest invitation-only society for scholar-athletes, often likened to Americas Skull and Bones. Known for producing power brokers in British finance and public life, its alumni include prime ministers, military generals, and global dealmakers. DK built early ties with peers who now hold influential roles across finance, government, and policy from London to the Gulf. DK also thrived in competition, becoming a national champion in the 4100-meter relay, the worlds 3-ranked StarCraft II player, and breaking two world records in rowing. DKs early success came from hard work and resilience, which he humbly attributes to his upbringing by a 15-year-old single mother in Denmark, who would stop at nothing to ensure her son was set up for success. She sacrificed everything to put me in the best position possible, DK recalls. Even now, with me living abroad, she continues to give up more than I can put into words. Building something significant is my way of making it all worth it. The problem: AI is advancing but the data it needs doesnt exist yet DK launched his career as a business analyst for McKinsey Company in London, where he led and co-authored the firms flagship European banking productivity study. During that time, he began building relationships with senior figures inside one of the worlds largest sovereign wealth funds, which now place him within a rare circle of operators trusted with long-term national priorities. Shortly afterwards, he was recruited by Citadel Securities and named an executive committee member for the companys Europe branches before he even turned 30, an impressive appointment at one of the most important firms in global finance, giving him a seat at the table where key regulatory, geopolitical, and strategic decisions were shaped. During his tenure at Citadel, DK led the firms Brexit transition strategy across Europe, the Middle East, and Africa as COO overseeing the seamless migration of trading operations in equities, futures, and options. Citadel completed this transition without any publicly reported trading disruptions, at a time when many financial institutions were preparing for significant operational risk. It was this project that exposed him to agentic AI and the problem which led him to develop NakedSignal. Thanks to his work with algorithmic trading, DK knew that agentic AI required access to structured and dynamic data in real time, but it took a close call at Citadel to fully understand the business impact. I remember walking along London Bridge to work at Citadel when my phone buzzedone of our main data streams was down. By the time I got to the office, Id gathered all our top AI and hardware engineers, and by noon, we were back online. In an industry where every hour out of the market meant more than 10 million in missed profits, we couldnt afford even a minute of downtime. Situations like these are resolved behind closed doors, where only a handful of trusted operators quietly make decisions with systemic impact. For DK, it wasnt the first time hed been in such a room, and it wouldnt be the last. Citadel and DK were lucky that there was an existing infrastructure in place to fix the problem. What DK realized was that, outside of hedge funds, few companies had the resources to set up these real-time data systems, let alone fix them if they failed. There was a gap that urgently needed filling. The build: launching NakedSignal to architect the backbone of real-time AI DK created NakedSignal as an infrastructure company rather than an AI startup. As the rest of the world starts to truly adopt automation through agentic AI, they will also need access to this real-time data, he explains. NakedSignals goal isnt to turn every company into one that operates at nanosecond speed like a hedge fund, at least right away, but to help them evolve from using months-old data to daily, hourly, and potentially real-time information. To achieve this, NakedSignal aims to provide reliable access to fresh data which can then be used to feed AI systems, essentially bridging the gap in modern data access. Still officially in stealth, NakedSignals infrastructure is already being evaluated by top-tier hedge funds and the company is rumoured to be in discussions with a shortlist of government-linked entities tasked with preparing national AI infrastructure. Looking forward: a 5 trillion futureand the race to power it Over the course of his career, DK has come to a crucial realization: the data infrastructure market is only in its infancy. As part of his broader vision, DK is authoring a book published by Hans Reitzels Forlag, an imprint of Gyldendal, Denmarks largest and oldest publisher. The book presents a new way to turn unstructured data into real-time infrastructure for AI systems operating in high-stakes environments. From coding bots for games as a child to starting NakedSignal to address inefficiencies with data use in artificial intelligence, DKs life has revolved around systems optimization, not just how they run, but who controls them. In an era where AI is becoming a core pillar of national competitiveness and global security, DK is part of a small group of builders shaping the infrastructure that everything else will rely on.

When generative AI tools were first unveiled to the public in 2022, many saw the tools as little more than an oddity. After all, despite the fact that the platforms behind the tech were eager to embrace the title of AI and all of the pop-cultural connotations that came with it, it wasnt actually artificial intelligence, and still isnt. Less of a self-thinking, autonomous piece of machinery and more equivalent to a digital blender, AI proved capable of combing through vast amounts of data in a matter of moments and regurgitating information from it in a new context. While the reality of the tools capabilities might have been seen as lackluster years ago, that weakness has since become one of these platforms greatest strengths, with AI proving its value to various businesses several times over. Today, many of the top-performing companies worldwide utilize AI tools to help them analyze data, make informed decisions, and even predict future trends. The tool has become so intrinsically woven into many industries most prominent players that it has shifted the foundations of numerous sectors in the span of just a few short years. However, for as practical and useful a tool as AI can be, a persistent question has plagued many users: why cant these tools present clear charts and visuals to go alongside the copious amounts of information theyre recontextualizing for the user? While several AI tools are great at generating text, they often miss the mark when it comes to visuals and specialized knowledge. Thats where Skywork.ai stands out. Its designed to give detailed, accurate research that includes clear charts, graphs, and insights, just the kind of output busy professionals need for meetings or reports. With its new professional database launched on July 17, skywork.ai is offering something unique. If youre looking for an AI platform that saves time and delivers results you can use, Skywork may be the tool youve been waiting for. The deep research battlefield: where AI tools stand today Companies have begun increasingly turning to AI to speed up research and simplify decision-making. However, when professionals request financial reports, legal references, or competitor analyses with visuals, they often encounter a barrier. For example, asking general AI tools for a market comparison of tech companies might give you five paragraphs of insights, but only one in ten times will it include a usable chart. The tool may provide accurate information, but it rarely includes any graphics. Why this matters When youre creating a boardroom presentation, paragraphs dont cut it. You want charts, timelines, side-by-side comparison visuals, that sort of thing, which will help explain the data fast. As a result, professionals often spend more time formatting and editing than analyzing. What makes Skywork different Skywork was built to solve this exact problem, and it achieves this in three key ways. 1. Visuals are always included and spot-on Skyworks DeepResearch engine ensures every report includes rich visual contentnot just text. Each report embeds an average of 3.2 charts, spanning five types of visual templates such as line graphs, bar charts, scatter plots, tables, and timelines. They are auto-generated in business-ready formats, suitable for stakeholder decks, investor updates, and strategic briefs. 2. Cost-effective for companies While enterprise AI can be powerful, it often comes at a steep cost. Skywork adopts a streamlined agent architecture with efficient retrieval and output planning, enabling it to deliver high-quality results at a fraction of the cost. For example, processing 1 million input tokens plus 60,000 output tokens on Skywork costs just 1.20, compared to 3.90 for the same workload on Claude 3.7 or 4. This makes Skywork both more efficient and more cost-effective than its competitors, especially for teams running daily, large-volume research. 3. Find more sources When prompted to analyze the trend of renewables in Asia, a submission from Skywork offered policy updates, regional market specifics, investment prospects, and even year-over-year growth images, along with real source links. Skywork stands apart by transforming deep research into structured, presentation-ready slides, a feature that sets it apart from other AI platforms. While most tools focus on generating plain text or outlines, Skywork combines real-time data retrieval, critical analysis, and visual storytelling into cohesive slide decks. This makes it uniquely suited for consultants, analysts, and decision-makers who need to turn insights into impactfast. Under the hood: what powers Skyworks deep research Skywork.ais Deep Research Agent leverages millions of agentic interaction logs collected from real-world complex knowledge tasks across domains such as finance, healthcare, policy, and law. The model has undergone extensive end-to-end reinforcement learning to optimize for reasoning accuracy, planning depth, and factual reliability. When given a task, the agent dynamically selects from a curated set of over 20 specialized toolsincluding web search, document summarization, code execution, graph generation, table extraction, and citation formattingto collaboratively plan and execute the task. It connects to the live Internet, performing intelligent, multi-step search sessions that can scan through hundreds of sources and extract key insights from dozens of documents within seconds. The result is a research output that is not only fast and comprehensive, but also deeply contextualized and citation-ready, supporting business, academic, or legal decision-making with traceable evidence and structured summaries. Skywork.ais deep research model also emphasizes the quality and authority of collected information. It features functionalities that verify the correctness of its data and present customers with industry-standard data visualizations that can be trusted in high-stakes business environments. The breakthrough in July: launch of Skywork professional database Many AI tools depend heavily on public sources like Wikipedia or online news, which are insufficient for the needs of modern businesses. Executives and analysts require timely, structured data from regulatory filings, court rulings, market intelligence, and specialized databases. On July 17, Skywork took a major leap forward with the launch of Skywork Professional Database, its enterprise-grade professional knowledge base. This marked a key differentiator from general-purpose AI platforms, enabling Skywork to deliver business-level intelligence and sector-specific insights with precision. The first wave of integrated sources includes: SEC EDGAR: The Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval system operated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Alpha Vantage: A global financial database covering stocks, forex, and cryptocurrencies. Financial Modeling Prep (FMP): A U.S. data provider offering company filings, quotes, valuation models, and fund data for publicly listed firms. GovInfo: The official digital repository from the U.S. Government Publishing Office, containing federal legal and policy documents. e-Gov: A legal database managed by Japans Ministry of Internal Affairs, featuring national laws, ministerial ordinances, and government orders. CiNii Japans largest academic database, operated by the National Institute of Informatics, offers peer-reviewed papers and scholarly publications. Together, these sources give Skywork a foundational edge in trusted, verifiable, and structured data, which is essential for high-stakes business research. Specialized knowledge in key markets Skyworks extensive knowledge base already offers accurate support for users across different regions and industries. For English-speaking users, Skywork offers comprehensive financial research tools such as real-time stock quotes, including trading prices and volumes, fundamental valuation metrics, and financial and operational ratios. It also enhances the process of searching for legal information by allowing users to access summaries of case law and regulatory guidance. For Japanese and Korean users, the platform also provides localized financial analysis, offering access to filings and frameworks specific to the Asia-Pacific region. While full legal research tools for these languages are still under development, coverage is expected in upcoming updates. The AI-generated presentation included charts on local policy, visualized market trends, and detailed investment return comparisons, all properly formatted and fully sourced, demonstrating how Skywork.ais specialized tools can transform complex data into business-ready outputs. Skywork presents a clearer picture When institutions consider AI tools for research, the real question is: How well do they work in practice? Many popular tools are known for advanced text generation but can be weaker in areas important to professionals, like visual output, depth of analysis, and specialized expertise in different domains. Thats where Skywork stands out by specifically addressing those gaps. Skywork includes 2-4 charts in every report, something that other AI generative tools rarely do, if ever. Skyworks visual templates are polished, business-ready, and more interactive with the audience, unlike the plain or mostly text-based outputs from others. Its also more cost-effective, approximately 40 cheaper than other leading AI tools, making it a smart choice for teams that need reliable, ready-to-use reports without extra formatting or editing. Why Skywork.ai may be leading the future Skyworks focus on visual intelligence and domain-specific knowledge shows what the future of enterprise AI will look like. As businesses demand more presentation-ready outputs, tools that can combine data, design, and depth will win. And with features like Skywork Professional Database, its clear that skywork.ai isnt just catching up, its building ahead. Final thoughts AI is changing fast, but enterprise needs are clear: real insights, smart visuals, and reliable data. Skywork.ai is answering that call with a system that does more than talk; it thinks, designs, and delivers.

From pilot to payoff: Turning AI investment into real ROI|Presented by Google Cloud Ignoring agentic AIs potential, particularly its demand for modernized data infrastructure, carries the same existential risk that faced retailers who ignored the internet. The question isnt whether to invest, but how to ensure those investments translate into measurable, real-world payoff. But measuring tangible return on agentic AI investment can feel elusive. So how should you position yourself for the agentic AI future, while also ensuring measurable successes along the way? Get clearer about what youre aiming for This is a crucial moment for enterprises to move beyond the tinkering phase of AI. The era of experimenting for experimentations sake is over. Todays models are powerful, but their value depends on the clarity of the outcomes theyre meant to achieve. Without a sharp understanding of business objectives, even the most advanced AI capabilities risk becoming expensive science projects. Its time to get precise about what success looks like, and build towards it deliberately. For instance, agents now manage governance, orchestrate pipelines, accelerate onboarding, and enhance customer engagement. Some benefits are easily quantified, like a 15 lift in marketing conversion or a 40 drop in onboarding time. Others are more structural, such as optimized resource utilization and the elimination of redundant tools. When starting out, determine what use cases make the most impact in the least amount of time, and build from there. Governance: Where ROI takes root So how do you model more specific ROI goals into your AI strategy? It starts with governance. This isnt just about compliance; governance agents actively enforce policies, dynamically detect schema drift, and pinpoint lineage gaps in real time. That creates trustable feedback loops for both developers and executives evaluating outcomes. Successful organizations arent fixated on a single big AI use case. Theyre embedding agents across the stack, from customer-facing applications to internal systems for governance, data quality monitoring, and workload optimization. Without a strong command of your data, however, understanding what these agents achieve and, more importantly, measuring their ROI, becomes impossible. As the investor and author Robert Kiyosaki noted, The rich dont work for money; they make money work for them. A similar principle applies to your data. When your data is agile, clean, and actively working for you improving decisions, training sophisticated systems, and powering autonomous agents ROI from AI becomes not just theoretical, but real. The most successful early adopters built governance deliberately. They invested in metadata systems, automation, and domain-based organization. This creates efficiencies, from eliminating redundant data pipelines to speeding delivery. The payoff isnt always immediate, but it is foundational. Robust governance transforms raw data into a reliable, usable product that enables agents to deliver consistent, repeatable value. Measuring ROI across the stack ROI can emerge in many places, and not all of them look the same. On the business side, agentic AI is already delivering impact. Marketing teams use generative agents for hyper-personalized campaigns, while sales and support teams deploy copilots that dramatically improve response times and customer satisfaction. These are direct accelerators for revenue and key performance indicators. For example, I recently spoke with a financial services firm that used generative agents to personalize onboarding sequences, cutting customer setup time from two weeks to three days, while improving conversion by 20. On the supply side, AI agents are optimizing infrastructure, significantly reducing manual work, and mitigating risk. This includes automating complex governance, improving observability, and intelligently tuning workloads to reduce spend. These efficiency gains often materialize more quickly than customer-facing improvements. A common antipattern is fragmented platforms. When teams adopt overlapping tools, hidden costs pile up. Whether you run a unified platform or a mixed environment, significant ROI is gained by reducing duplication and consolidating workloads. Interoperability matters. When agents operate across systems and governance is consistent, both compute and operational costs fall. The most agile and successful enterprises relentlessly streamline their core platforms. Think of AI ROI as a continuum. Some investments yield immediate returns. Others build long-term value. The key is knowing where you are and what to measure. From guesswork to guidance Dont treat AI as a mere cost-cutting tool. Its deeper opportunity is horizontal: helping teams to move faster, innovate more, and focus on higher-value work. This benefit, however, only materializes if your data is ready, and that readiness begins with governance. By making ROI visible and trackable, governance inherently breaks down the organizational silos that fragment efforts and dilute results. It establishes a shared framework that directly aligns data investments with company-wide OKRs. In this age of agentic AI, ROI isnt a static number on a dashboard; its a distributed force waiting to be captured across your enterprise.

amp just raised the bar for digital gyms with an AI coach that learns as you lift|The connected fitness industry has spent the past decade digitizing traditional gym experiences, streaming classes, tracking basic metrics, and building content libraries. But a new wave of AI-driven workouts is challenging this entire model with something that cant easily be replicated: artificial intelligence that actually thinks during your training session. amp, a US-based fitness innovation startup, is launching what may be the industrys most sophisticated AI Coach to beta users this month, with plans for broader deployment throughout 2025. Unlike existing smart home gym platforms that rely on pre-recorded content and static programming, amps adaptive fitness technology creates workout plans that evolve in real-time based on thousands of performance indicators. The technical challenge behind adaptive fitness technology Building effective AI-driven workouts requires solving problems that dont exist in other AI applications. Unlike recommendation engines or chatbots, fitness AI must understand the dynamic relationship between human physiology and performance adaptation variables that shift constantly based on sleep, stress, recovery, and dozens of other factors. Traditional fitness platforms treat performance fluctuations as noise to be filtered out, explains a spokesperson for amp. We treat them as essential metrics that inform better training decisions. When you complete an exercise, amp doesnt just record weight and repetitions. The adaptive fitness technology analyzes movement velocity, range of motion consistency, rest period duration, and how these metrics compare to your historical patterns. This multidimensional approach creates AI-driven workouts that understand not only what you accomplished, but how efficiently you accomplished it. Real-time processing meets predictive analytics Most fitness tracking operates reactively documenting what happened after exercises are completed. amps AI Coach takes a predictive approach, using machine learning models to anticipate what your body needs next based on subtle performance indicators that precede conscious fatigue recognition. The technical architecture processes multiple data streams simultaneously through computer vision systems that track movement patterns via smartphone cameras, electromagnetic sensors that monitor cable tension and velocity, and accelerometers that capture micro-movements indicating form breakdown or readiness for progression. This creates feedback loops that operate on millisecond timescales, enabling the adaptive fitness technology to modify resistance patterns during exercises rather than between them. If movement velocity decreases beyond optimal ranges, the AI Coach can reduce load before form deterioration compromises safety or training effectiveness. Machine learning models that evolve with users The sophistication of amps approach lies in its neural networks optimized for time-series biomechanical data. Unlike rule-based algorithms that follow predetermined decision trees, these models develop an increasingly nuanced understanding of individual user physiology over time. The AI-driven workouts platform maintains detailed performance models across different exercises, recovery states, and environmental factors. When users begin sessions, the system already has predictive frameworks in place that account for likely performance based on training history, sleep data from connected wearables, and circadian rhythm patterns. These predictions enable proactive programming adjustments. The adaptive fitness technology might pre-load lighter resistances if recovery indicators suggest suboptimal readiness, or recommend power-focused exercises when biomarkers indicate peak performance states. Celebrity expertise through AI avatar technology amp combines this technical sophistication with coaching knowledge from fitness industry experts like Terry Crews, Chris Heria, and Kinga Strogoff. Rather than simply streaming pre-recorded content, the platform uses what they term AI Avatar technology to apply expert coaching principles to individual user situations in real-time. The AI-driven workouts system understands the biomechanical rationale behind coaching decisions and adapts expert guidance to specific user capabilities and limitations. When Terry Crews emphasizes explosive movement patterns for power development, the adaptive fitness technology identifies optimal moments for these cues based on current user strength levels and movement quality. Hardware innovation enables software sophistication The effectiveness of AI-driven workouts depends heavily on hardware capable of executing real-time decisions. amps electromagnetic resistance system can modify load patterns smoothly during individual repetitions a capability that traditional mechanical systems cannot match. Three distinct resistance modes demonstrate this integration: Band Mode simulates progressive resistance band behavior with real-time curve modifications based on user performance. Eccentric Mode adds load during lowering phases while modulating this additional resistance based on fatigue indicators. Fixed Mode maintains consistent challenge throughout movements but adjusts baseline resistance automatically based on form quality metrics. This hardware-software integration enables adaptive workouts that feel responsive rather than predetermined, creating training experiences that evolve with user capability in ways that static programming cannot achieve. Market implications for fitness technology amps approach represents a fundamental shift from content-driven platforms to intelligence-driven training. While competitors can hire celebrity instructors or improve video production quality, they cannot easily replicate machine learning systems that understand individual user physiology without significant infrastructure investment. The companys 1,795 device price point, combined with 23 monthly subscriptions supporting up to 15 household members, disrupts traditional smart fitness economics. Unlike content platforms where additional users dont significantly enhance core experiences, amps AI-driven workouts become more valuable as they learn from diverse user patterns within the same household. The trajectory of intelligent fitness As amp continues to expand AI Coach capabilities throughout 2025, its adaptive fitness technology suggests a future where workout equipment genuinely understands user goals, limitations, and daily variations. This moves beyond tracking what happened to predicting what should happen next a distinction that may define the next generation of fitness technology. The engineering principles behind amps AI-driven workouts could eventually inform everything from physical therapy protocols to athletic performance optimization, demonstrating how sophisticated AI applications can emerge from solving real human problems rather than purely technical challenges. For an industry built on helping people achieve consistent progress, intelligence that adapts to human variability rather than ignoring it may be the most important innovation of all.

CoSyn: The open-source tool that’s making GPT-4V-level vision AI accessible to everyone|Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania and the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence have developed a groundbreaking tool that allows open-source AI systems to match or surpass the visual understanding capabilities of proprietary models like GPT-4V and Gemini 1.5 Flash, potentially reshaping the competitive landscape between open and closed AI development. The tool, called CoSyn (Code-Guided Synthesis), addresses a critical bottleneck in AI development: the scarcity of high-quality training data for teaching machines to understand complex visual information like scientific charts, medical diagrams, and financial documents. Rather than scraping millions of images from the internet a practice fraught with copyright and ethical concerns CoSyn leverages the coding abilities of existing language models to generate synthetic training data. We have, we lack of such data to train the model. We lack of data, like documents, charts with rich annotations to train a vision language model to do question answering over those images, explained Yue Yang, a recent Penn Engineering Ph.D. graduate and co-first author of the research, during an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. Those images actually are more challenging to annotate, compared to natural photos, like a picture of a dog of a cat of a house. The breakthrough comes as enterprises increasingly seek AI systems capable of understanding and reasoning about complex visual information capabilities essential for everything from automated document processing to AI agents that can navigate digital interfaces independently. The work was conducted during Yangs internship with the PRIOR team at the Allen Institute for AI and supported by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity, and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. How synthetic data generation solves AIs biggest training challenge The challenge of training AI to understand text-rich images has long plagued the field. Unlike natural photographs, scientific figures, charts, and documents require extensive annotation work that is both time-consuming and expensive. Traditional approaches have relied on harvesting images and their alt-text descriptions from the internet, but this method produces training data that is often superficial and legally problematic. CoSyn takes a fundamentally different approach by recognizing that most text-rich images are originally created through code Python scripts generate charts, LaTeX renders mathematical equations, HTML creates web interfaces. The research teams insight was to reverse this process: use language models proven coding abilities to generate the underlying code, then execute that code to create realistic synthetic images. One intuition is actually those images like charts documents. We render them from programs from code, like we use Python to generate charts. We use, like latex or word to write our documents, Yang said. So how about we go through the reverse way, like we generated the code because the text only language model has been proved very good at writing code. Chris Callison-Burch, a computer science professor at Penn who co-advised the research, described the approach in simpler terms: This is like taking a student whos great at writing and asking them to teach someone how to draw, just by describing what the drawing should look like. Were essentially transferring the strengths of open-source AI from text to vision. CoSyn-trained models outperform GPT-4V and Gemini on key benchmarks The results are striking. Using their synthetic dataset of 400,000 images and 2.7 million instruction pairs, models trained with CoSyn achieved state-of-the-art performance among open-source systems and surpassed proprietary models on seven benchmark tests measuring text-rich image understanding. On average, their 7-billion parameter model scored 80.9 across the benchmark suite, outperforming the previous best open-source model (Llama 3.2 11B) by 3.9 percentage points. More remarkably, even their zero-shot modeltrained without any examples from the evaluation datasetsoutperformed most open and closed models, demonstrating the transferability of capabilities learned from synthetic data. CoSyn-trained models outperformed GPT-4V and Gemini 1.5 Flash across seven text-rich image understanding benchmarks. (Credit: github.iocosyn) In one particularly compelling demonstration, the researchers created a new benchmark called NutritionQA, consisting of 100 questions about nutrition label photographs. Using just 7,000 synthetically generated nutrition labels for training, their model outperformed others trained on millions of real images. Despite being trained on millions of images, we observe that open-source VLMs are not data-efficient and perform poorly on this novel task compared to GPT-4V, the researchers wrote in their paper. Yang emphasized the significance: Those big packs, they have so many resources to collecting data to run a lot of experiments, and I but I think open source models, we can give access to people, the model weights, the data we trained, or even the code, the training script, everything people can developers can build upon. Real companies are already using vision AI for quality control and automation The technology is already finding real-world applications across industries. Callison-Burch cited an example from one of his teaching assistants whose company uses vision-language models for cable installation quality assurance: They have the workers on site who are doing the installation take photographs of the processes theyre doing it, and they use that to automatically validate that each step has been followed properly. This type of specialized visual understanding could transform numerous enterprise workflows, from automated document processing in financial services to quality control in manufacturing. The ability to train models on specific visual tasks using synthetic data means companies can develop AI systems tailored to their particular needs without the massive data collection efforts traditionally required. For enterprise decision makers, the research suggests a shift in how to approach AI data strategies. I think synthetic data is a very promising way to remove the effort for human annotation. It costs less money, and it will just automatically generate large scale data, and also can avoid some copyright issues, Yang noted. The persona-driven approach that makes AI training data more diverse One of CoSyns key innovations is its approach to ensuring data diversity. To prevent the repetitive outputs common in AI-generated content, the system employs what the researchers call a persona-driven mechanism. Each time CoSyn generates a synthetic example, it pairs the request with a randomly sampled personaa short description like a sci-fi novelist constantly bouncing off ideas for new alien worlds or a chemistry teacher preparing lab materials. Every time we generate one syntax data, we will appear with a randomly sampled persona, Yang explained. This will diversify the content and styles of the examples we generated, because, like, if I provide the persona of like a PhD student, it will generate something more scientific or more about, something about academia. This approach enables the system to generate content across nine different categories: charts, documents, math problems, tables, diagrams, vector graphics, music sheets, electrical circuits, and chemical structures. The researchers used 11 different rendering tools, from Pythons Matplotlib for charts to LaTeX for mathematical expressions, supported by 20 specialized generation pipelines. Why this breakthrough could level the playing field between open source and Big Tech The implications for the broader AI industry are significant. Major technology companies like OpenAI and Google have invested billions in developing their proprietary vision-language capabilities, creating systems whose training methods and data sources remain trade secrets. CoSyn offers a path for open-source alternatives to compete without requiring similar resource investments. Open source models still like, like behind those closed source models, but with all the efforts, all the resources from the open source community, everyone, like, weve had more efforts. We have more like energy, like from, from everyone. So I think finally we can catch up, Yang said. The commitment to openness extends beyond just releasing the model. The complete CoSyn codebase, the 400,000-image dataset, and all training scripts are publicly available, enabling researchers and companies worldwide to build upon the work. From the academia side, like a lot of research is built upon openness, like we need all access to the data, code, everything to discover new findings to support our claims in the papers, Yang emphasized. This transparency addresses growing concerns about the black-box nature of proprietary AI systems. If you only rely on the APIs for like open AI, this may not be reliable to prove your like scientific discoveries, because they may just. Something in the back end you never know, Yang noted. Teaching AI agents to click, scroll and navigate like humans Beyond static image understanding, CoSyn is pioneering capabilities crucial for the next generation of AI agentssystems that can autonomously navigate digital interfaces and perform complex tasks. The researchers developed synthetic pointing data that teaches models exactly where to click on screenshots, a fundamental requirement for web-based automation. Using 65,000 synthetic screenshots with click annotations, their model achieved state-of-the-art performance on ScreenSpot, a benchmark for click prediction, outperforming systems trained on 1.3 million real screenshots. We only use like several 100k synthetic screenshot, we can outperform previous model on millions of screenshots, Yang said. This capability is essential as the industry moves toward AI agents that can perform knowledge work autonomously. Theres sort of like two prevailing models and how you might go about implementing agents, Callison-Burch explained. One approach uses specialized APIs, while the other relies on agents that literally just use web browsing capabilities in the same way that you and I do. The vision-based approach, enabled by technologies like CoSyn, could prove more versatile: Youre not just calling up software function, which is relatively straightforward, but you actually have to, like, take screenshots of the current state of the web browser. Reason about where to click, navigate your mouse to that location to click. How synthetic data sidesteps the growing copyright crisis in AI training The synthetic data approach also provides a potential solution to mounting legal challenges around AI training data. With ongoing litigation over whether training on copyrighted materials constitutes fair use, synthetic data generation offers an alternative path that sidesteps many intellectual property concerns. Callison-Burch, who testified before Congress on AI and copyright in 2023, sees synthetic data as complementary to, rather than replacing, real-world training data: I dont think that synthetic data eliminates the need for having wide amounts of diverse training data like thats still a core element to training AI systems, but it does allow you to extend their capabilities in really remarkable ways. The approach demonstrates how existing knowledge can be transferred to new applications without directly using copyrighted materials. The underlying thing that were relying on here is a large language model. Can write code thats something that it learned from its original data. Were now applying that to a totally different application, which is creation of new training data that is unlike any of the data that it was trained on. The current limits of synthetic data and what comes next Despite its promise, synthetic data generation faces important limitations. One limitation is it may inherit the biases from the model that generates such synthetic data, Yang acknowledged. The system can also struggle with diversity: If you prompt a large network to generate some data among different runs, it may generate similar data. The current research focuses on text-rich images rather than natural photographs, limiting its immediate applicability to some domains. What about some real photos like some other like natural images? It is hard to generate synthetic data for those two males, or even like medical images, chest X rays, Yang noted, though she indicated ongoing efforts to extend the approach to medical imaging. Looking ahead, Yang expects synthetic data generation to become standard practice: In the future, in two or three years, and even for nothing, editor has been a very important component to teach model different capabilities. However, she emphasized that optimal results will likely require combining synthetic and real-world data: Real world data will reflect some real world distributions. Single data can be large scale. Can be more controllable. Early adopters from Meta to Amazon are already experimenting with the technology Early adoption signals suggest the technology is already influencing industry practices. I heard like companies, like meta, some teams also, like all Amazon, they are trying to using our data to train their model, Yang revealed during the interview. For startups and smaller companies, the cost advantages could be particularly significant. For some startups, it is cheaper to host, their host open model on their server, rather than just calling the APIs, which is less controllable, Yang noted. The research teams decision to make everything open source reflects a broader philosophy about AI development. As Yang prepares to join the Allen Institute full-time after completing her Ph.D., the commitment to open science remains central to their mission. Currently, those vision language models are quite brittle. It just needs the right data to get the right capabilities, she said. If you find the right data, you can improve models capability on it, and it will benefit the society. The vision for AI that acts, not just describes As the research moves from academic laboratories to real-world applications, the implications extend far beyond improved benchmark scores. Yang and her colleagues are already looking toward applications that could transform how people with disabilities interact with technology, from AI that understands sign language for the hearing impaired to systems that can describe complex medical images for those with visual impairments. I have an idea to let the model to know how to understand the sign language or those people with hearing difficulties, Yang said, describing potential future applications. If you find the right data, you can improve models capability on it, and it will benefit the society. Callison-Burch sees even broader possibilities, particularly in robotics and scientific discovery: Synthetic data opens up many possible applications that we dont have naturally occurring data for. So one that Yang has also worked on at the Allen Institute is that. Ocean of creating simulated training data for robots. The work represents more than just a technical achievementits a demonstration that open-source AI development can compete with the well-funded efforts of major technology companies through innovative approaches to fundamental challenges. As Yang noted in reflecting on her decision to join the Allen Institute rather than accept higher-paying offers from companies like Meta: I think its still a very early stage of those multimodal models, and there are not much resources, open resources, or knowledge to share to the community. The message is clear: in the race to build AI that can truly see and understand the world, the advantage may not always go to those with the deepest pockets, but to those with the most creative solutions.

Why organizations in the public sector are using case management software|The catch-22 nearly everyone in the public sector can relate to is: How can you deliver services efficiently while meeting complex administrative demands? Everything from social services to public safety contends with outdated, paper-based workflows that just arent cutting it anymore. The result? Inefficiency and service delivery delays. Of course, expectations only continue to rise while budgets tend to fall. The need for modern solutions is clear. Yet the answer to improve outcomes and streamline operations is already here in the form of Case Management Software. The public sectors continued struggle to manage case data Contending with massive amounts of case data is par for the course in many public agencies. Yet the reliance on manual paperwork and processing doesnt exactly make it easy. These processes often lead to buildups, a lack of communication between departments, and ultimately, risk compliance due to human error. Digital transformation is key to meeting the expectation of quick and transparent results that remain secure and collaborative. Getting to know case management software So, what exactly is case management software? Its essentially a tool that helps organizations deal with complex workflows, data security, and documentation. As for public sector agencies, case management software can provide document automation, which significantly cuts down on manual labor and the risk of human error. It can also help get workflow management on track, allowing you to track cases right from intake and straight through to the resolution. Naturally, security is a top priority for any agency. Between data and security features that guard sensitive information to traceable audit trails, the software can be a useful tool for regulation compliance. Ultimately, caseworkers, managers, and stakeholders can all collaborate at once to keep things consistent and efficient. What can the software do for public sector agencies? Now that you have the what, its time to talk about the why. Like any other tool, the primary reason to adopt case management software is to improve operations. When you digitize records, you can avoid delays while simplifying case processing. Not only do transparency and accountability often improve, but reporting tools and audit logs can be useful to monitor case progress and quell any stress over whether or not operations are on the up and up. Centralized platforms can also be useful in allowing various departments to view and alter files (with authorization, of course). When it comes to retention and audit requirements, the software can make it much easier to maintain regulatory readiness. As a result, these improvements can trickle down to components of operations like service delivery, improving the ability to meet the publics strict expectations. A versatile software There isnt just one setting that case management software benefits. Maybe a social service agency uses it to better manage client interactions and distribution. Perhaps court systems increase efficiency by tracking files and judicial decisions without a pile of paperwork. Public safety departments may enjoy the ability to organize records tied to investigations and reporting. Housing authorities might manage applications, inspections, and compliance processes with the click of a button instead of carting around dozens of files. Whos adopting case management software? While some organizations and agencies are slow to make use of the digital tools now at their disposal, many governments are taking the plunge. Bringing operations into the 21st century typically means improving service delivery and meeting modern challenges head-on. Between initiatives like the U.S. Digital Service and the UK Government Digital Strategy, organizations around the globe are seeing what ditching paper-based systems can do. Modern challenges will continue to get more complicated as the years tick by. The inability to adapt will only sharpen the pain points that organizations are already dealing with when it comes to outdated systems. The longer you wait, the worse the transition will get. Sure, it costs money to employ new software. Yet, when you look at the many struggles that case management software can improve, they often pay for themselves.

Inside reMarkable’s push to scale employee and customer IT requests with agentic AI|Presented by Salesforce As growing companies adopt AI to drive efficiency and scale, many are discovering that success depends less on the technology itself and more on how well their systems, teams, and data are connected. When systems dont talk to each other and information stays siloed, it becomes harder for AI to deliver meaningful impact. Thats why data integration is emerging as a top priority for tech leaders: it creates the foundation for AI agents to work in sync with people, taking real-time action, surfacing insights, and supporting faster decisions. This was the approach taken by reMarkable. As the paper-tablet maker expanded into the B2B market, it shifted to a more unified, platform-based strategy with a central hub for team collaboration. With this connected foundation and a 360-degree view of their customers in place, reMarkable was able to introduce AI agents to help scale both customers and employee support all while staying true to the premium experience its brand is known for. AI agents meet employees where they work reMarkables agent-first strategy found momentum in Slack, where a conversational interface and ocean of data from messages, files, and apps create the ideal environment for AI agents to embed seamlessly into employees day-to-day work. And its a timely move, with daily AI usage among desk workers having surged 233 in just six months a sign that reMarkables approach is tapping into a rapidly growing shift in how people get work done. The team began by tackling the high volume of routine IT requests employees made on a daily basis. Manually submitting and tracking tickets, hunting down knowledge articles, and navigating scattered systems were a drag on team productivity. To solve this, they built and rolled out Saga, an AI agent built with Salesforces digital labor platform Agentforce. Employees simply message Saga in Slack to get help and quick answers. When needed, the agent even automatically manages tickets behind the scenes, no context switching required. Sagas already helping teams move faster, reducing friction, cutting down on repetitive tasks, and giving IT more time to focus on strategic work. Having AI agents working alongside our employees directly in Slack is really powerful, said Nico Cormier, CTO at reMarkable. Not only do they become our team members, but given the amount of data and context we have in Slack, they become really intelligent team members that take actions right in the flow of work. That will have an enormous impact on productivity through time freed up for creative and strategic work, and ultimately company profits. Scaling customer support comes next reMarkable also extended their AI agent model to their customers. In just a few weeks, they launched Mark, a customer-facing agent that handles common support questions through a smart, conversational flow. Customers get fast and accurate answers, and when an issue calls for a human touch, Mark seamlessly hands it off to the right support rep to keep the experience smooth, efficient, and personal.

StellarIQ provides growth capital, access to the Max AI technology platform, and the expertise of founders who have grown businesses organically and inorganically from start-up to billion-dollar exits.
